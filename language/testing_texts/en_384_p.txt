in my view what we should be expecting from this presidency is not that it should manage to resolve all the problems currently facing the european union  something which would be physically impossible for reasons of time  but that by shaping wills and achieving consensus it should be capable of giving a boost to the process of european integration which is now at a critical point in its timetable

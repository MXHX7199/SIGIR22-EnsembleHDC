the history of any ancient cathedral must always be interesting and 
that of exeter is no exception though it supplies less of 
architectural history than those churches whose whole character has been 
altered over and over again  cathedral represents not only the 
spiritual but the active laborious and artistic life of past 
generations the bishop too was in many ways the head man of the 
province and combined not seldom the varied qualities of priest 
warrior and statesman the acts of such ecclesiastics were full of 
importance not for their own city only but often also for the whole 
nation as men who had frequently travelled much and studied deeply 
they summoned to their aid in the building and beautifying of their 
churches the most skilled artists end artificers of their time so with 
the story of the lives of the bishops of a diocese the history of a 
cathedrals building is inextricably woven to be elevated to a 
bishopric generally meant to be put into possession of great 
wealthwhen veysey became bishop the revenues of the see of exeter 
have by some authors been computed at  canon hingestonrandolph 
puts them with more reason and authority at the sum of  a 
large portion of this money was spent on works connected with the chief 
church of the diocese it is not wonderful therefore this generosity 
being joined to marvellous skill and taste that our old cathedrals are 
at once the despair and envy of the modern architect and it is with a 
feeling of reverence that one recalls the history of those who built in 
the heart of each populous city grey cliffs of lonely stone into the 
midst of sailing birds and silent air 

the story of exeter has an unique interest and its church as we shall 
see is in many respects without a rival the fact that a building of 
such great beauty should adorn a city so situated is remarkable for 
long afteras we read in macaulayweekly posts left london for various 
parts of england exeter was still as it were on the borders of 
territories scarcely explored and was the furthest western point to 
which letters were conveyed from the metropolis fuller thus describes 
the county of devonshire in his day  devonshire hath the narrow 
seas on the south the severn on the north cornwall on the west dorset 
and somersetshire on the east  goodly province the second in england 
for greatness clear in view without measuring as bearing a square of 
fifty miles some part thereof as the south hams is so fruitful it 
needs no art but generally though not running of itself it answers to 
the spur of industry no shire showes more industrious or so many 
husbandmen who by marle blew and white chalk lime seasand 
compost sopeashes rags and what not make the ground both to take and 
keep a moderate fruitfulness so that virgil if now alive might make 
additions to his georgicks from the ploughpractice in this county as 
for the natives thereof generally they are dexterous in any employment 
and queen elizabeth was wont to say of the gentry they were all born 
courtiers with a becomming confidence 

the city of exeter is of great age isca damnoniorum caer wise 
exanceaster exeter keeping essentially the same name under all 
changes stands distinguished as the one great city which has in a more 
marked way than any other kept its unbroken being and its unbroken 
position throughout all ages but though whitaker asserts that in the 
middle of the fifth century it was the seat of a bishop professor 
freeman with more authority declares that the city did not become a 
bishops see till the latter half of the eleventh century at which 
period the bishopstools were removed from the small to the great towns 
until   devonshire formed part of the vast diocese of wessex 
about the year   the diocese of devon and cornwall was divided 
into twothe former with its bishops seat at creditononly to be 
reunited again a hundred and fifty years later when leofric was 
appointed bishop 

the first record of a church dedicated to  mary and peter in exeter 
is that of an abbey church founded by athelstan but sweyn destroyed it 
seventy years later and it seems frequently to have been attacked by 
invaders previous to its destruction but in  canute endowed a new 
church and confirmed by charter their lands and privileges to the monks 
this building must have been of some pretensions for it was given to 
leofric for his cathedral church in  it occupied the site of the 
present lady chapel when warelwast and marshall built their norman 
church they placed it on the east of the old church leaving an 
intervening space their nave occupied the site of the present nave the 
transeptal towers were the same but the choir was shorter and probably 
terminated in an apse flanked by smaller apses at the ends of the choir 
aisles traces of one of these have been found at the end of the third 
bay of the north choir aisle bronscombe and quivil see p  began 
their reconstruction at this end and by adding the ambulatory and lady 
chapel linked together the sites of the old and new churches 

with the episcopate of leofric exeter first assumes the rank of a 
cathedral city the sees of devon and cornwall had been held together by 
lyfing the last bishop of crediton but crediton an unfortified 
vill was an easy prey to the irish danes and other pirates who 
devastated the diocese from time to time leofric felt the urgent 
necessity for a change and fixed on the walled town of exeter to be his 
cathedral city he sent a clerk to the pope asking him to write to the 
king recommending the change the king readily consented and the church 
of st mary and st peter was given to the bishop as his cathedral 
church the event was clearly regarded as of considerable importance 
for at his installation edward the confessor supported his right arm 
and queen eadgytha his left archbishops bishops and nobles also 
assisted at the ceremony leofric proved a hardworking and wise 
prelate and gave generously of lands and moneys to his church he had 
found it but poorly furnished the wardrobe only containing one 
worthless priests dress he also remembered it in his will and the 
great liber exoniensis was his gift 

but if the history of the see has its birth with leofric the story of 
the cathedral begins with the appointment in  of warelwast as 
bishop this noteworthy man was a nephew of the conqueror and chaplain 
to both william  and henry  inheriting to the full the norman 
passion for building he pulled down the saxon edifice and began to 
erect a great norman cathedral in its stead the transeptal towers 
attest the magnificence of his scheme there is nothing quite like them 
anywhere else though at barcelona and chalonssurmarne may be seen 
something similar but they suffice to stamp him as an architect of 
exceptional genius he laboured zealously in other matters founding at 
plympton a wealthy augustinian priory he also represented the king at 
rome in his famous quarrel with anselm it is said that he became blind 
and died an old man at his priory of plympton 

the next important date to notice is  when henry marshall brother 
of walter earl marshall was made bishop for two years the episcopal 
throne had remained empty the king being absent from england in the 
holy land but with the appointment of marshall a most important stage 
is reached king john gave to the see the tithes of the tin in 
devonshire and cornwall this must have largely increased the episcopal 
income for marshall quickly set about completing the work warelwast had 
begun a hundred years before to this end he granted the emoluments of 
st erths church near hayle cornwall to be used towards defraying 
the cost of repairs he also called upon each householder to show his 
interest in the work by subscribing at pentecost an alms of unum 
obolum ad minim for the sufficient remuneration of the choral vicars 
he made over to them the church of st swithun in woodbury with all 
its appurtenances 

to marshall we owe extensive additions to the nave the north porch and 
the cloister doorway he completed the norman church begun by warelwast 
but there is no evidence that he extended to the eastward as is 
sometimes stated the position of the tomb in the founders place on 
the north side of the choir indicates that it terminated only a few 
yards farther to the east beyond there must have been an open space 
between the norman and the old saxon cathedrals 

for nearly fifty years there are but scant records of work done to the 
building though professor  speaks of its not longlived 
perfection it is quite possible that marshalls work was considered 
by his own and the succeeding generation to be final any interest 
there may be in the lives of two of the succeeding bishops until the 
election of bronscombe in  is for the most part due to their 
labours in other matters for example under simon de apulia the city 
of exeter was divided into parishes and by william bruere the chapter 
house and stalls of the old choir were completed he was one of the 
leaders of the english army at acre in  he also created the deanery 
of exeter

longmans 

but with the arrival of walter bronscombe a new career of architectural 
energy begins now dawns that wonderful transformation period at the 
close of which the church stood pretty much as we now know it 
concerning bronscombes character there has been somewhat bitter 
dispute it is certain that he was accused of craftiness and meanness 
but william of worcester whose testimony is valuable called him walter 
le good whatever may be the real truth of the matter he seems to have 
made an admirable bishop his election reflecting considerable credit on 
the acumen of those concerned in it for he had not surely much to 
recommend him at first sight for so important a position though he 
was archdeacon of surrey at the time of his appointment he was not a 
priest and he was quite a young man he was a vigorous supporter of 
learning throughout the diocese probably because of his anxiety to give 
other men of humble origin a fair chance of making their way in the 
world he restored the college of crediton and built one at glaseney 
bronscombe may be credited with giving the first impetus to the 
reconstruction of the cathedral by his work in the lady chapel and the 
chapels on either side of it viz that of st mary magdalen on the 
north and st gabriel on the south the latter being destined for his 
own tomb to his dean and chapter he appropriated the church of st 
bruared in cornwall that the feast of his patron saint gabriel might 
be worthily maintained 

peter quivil his successor in the see was probably working with him 
as he was a canon of the cathedral before being raised to the bishopric 
he invented and designed the decorated cathedral and transformed the 
transepts he must be classed with warelwast as the chief of the 
building bishops admirably and sympathetically as his work was 
continued by those who followed him their claim on our recognition and 
gratitude is less his skill too seems to have been almost equalled by 
his generosity for out of gratitude the chapter promised to maintain 
his yearly obit in the office of the mass in the memento for the dead 
his name was ordered to be spoken primum et praecipium he seems to 
have given the franciscans some cause for anger it is suggested that 
his dominican confessor urged him to treat the followers of st francis 
with severity anyhow the aggrieved ones had their revenge for the 
bishops death which happened on the eve of st francis after 
drinking of a certain sirrop was popularly attributed to the direct 
intervention of the saint himself he is buried in the lady chapel 
which he had transformed and decorated with such tender care and a slab 
in the centre of the pavement bearing the legend petra tegit petrum 
nihil officiat sibi tetrum is dedicated to his memory 

it has been ascertained by canon hingestonrandolph that bishop quivil 
was the first to endow the office of chaunter with an adequate salary 
and that the first to enjoy the benefit of it was walter de lecchelade 
or lechlade though he was by no means the first chaunter or precentor 
 dispute that long agitated antiquaries has thus been settled for it 
was contended by some that john the chaunter was the first to hold the 
office by others that quivil founded the office and that the bishops 
name was really john cauntor but the explanation that the stipend was 
only increased by quivil and that it existed before his day was 
entirely satisfactory we may hope to the supporters of the rival 
theories the abovementioned walter lechlade was murdered about two in 
the morning on his return from matins in the cathedral cloisters the 
murderers escaped through the south gate of the city which was left 
open an extraordinary sensation was created not in exeter only but 
throughout england the bishop invited edward  and his queen to keep 
their christmas at the palace we are told they were very industrious 
in finding out the murtherers at last alfred dupont an exmayor and 
porter of the south gate was found guilty and executed accordingly 
perhaps had the office of chaunter not been endowed walter lechlade 
might have continued for many long years to chaunt in sonorous voice 
matins vespers obits and the like at any rate the story is worth 
telling being an interesting picture of manners in the middle ages it 
will be found given with many interesting details in an appendix by 
canon hingestonrandolph to his edition of the register of bishop quivil 
p  

quivils successor was thomas de bytton dean of wells under his 
guidance the work of transformation planned by his predecessor was 
loyally continued for he faithfully adhered to the original design 
though bytton appears to have been less active outside his diocese than 
many of the exeter bishops his mode of life must have commended itself 
to a large circle  grant of forty days indulgence was the reward of 
all those who availed themselves of his spiritual ministrations or 
offered prayers for his prosperity during his life and after death 
among the signatures appended to the document notifying this singular 
privilege are those of numerous archbishops and bishops among them 
being those of the archbishops of cosensa and jerusalem and manfred 
bishop of st marks venice the seal of manfred dr oliver says 
is perfect he stands robed with a piece of embroidery on his alb the 
crozier is simply curved his legend is      
  it was dated at rome in the year  possibly byttons 
great learning by which he had risen to be professor of canon law at 
oxford and popes chaplain was partly the reason of so notable a 
compliment but the noble work he was doing in the cathedral church of 
his diocese we may hope had not a little to do with the honour for to 
him we owe the entire transformation of the choir with its aisles 
byttons labours were indeed very great we hear of large quantities 
of stone procured from barley and of sandstone from salcombe and 
branscombe he also put a good deal of stained glass into the windows 
so that in the eleventh year of his episcopate the following item is 
recorded master walter le verrouer for setting the glass of the upper 
gable and of eight upper windows and of six windows in the aisles of 
the new work in gross   bytton was succeeded in  by 
walter de stapledon the most famous of all the bishops of exeter  
younger son of sir richard stapledon of annery his appointment was the 
first of a succession of aristocratic nominations he too had been a 
professor of canon law at oxford was a chaplain to the pope and 
precentor of the cathedral church of exeter the feast given after his 
enthronement was unusually splendid the revenues for a whole year being 
spent on the festivities it seems as though conscious of his great 
talents he determined to signalize his accession to the episcopal 
office by some event of unusual magnificence it must be remembered that 
exeter was at this time one of the largest and richest sees in england 
as professor freeman has pointed out the bishop of exeter like the 
archbishop of york was the spiritual head of a separate people 
stapledon set about expediting the work of transforming the cathedral 
into the decorated style in vigorous fashion the fabric rolls record 
that he himself gave the then enormous sum of  towards defraying 
the cost his generosity encouraged others to subscribe liberally 
towards the building fund one of his first duties was to complete the 
choir a payment being made to william canon of    for marble 
from corfe for the columns but the choir was really byttons the new 
bishop had only to give to it a few final though not unimportant 
touches still he found plenty of work to hand that might receive the 
impress of his sole initiative he designed and completed the triforium 
arcade above the choir arches and directed the colouring of the choir 
vault the total expenses for oil and colour being estimated at   
 by these final touches the transformation of the choir into the 
decorated style was completed but stapledon determined to further 
enrich his already beautiful church with accessories of surpassing 
splendour he erected a high altar of silver also the beautiful 
sedilia and though there has been a good deal of dispute about the 
matter the more trustworthy authorities attribute to him the bishops 
throne of carved wood at any rate in  there is a charge of  
  for timber for the bishops seat the altar unfortunately 
has disappeared but it is reputed to have cost a sum equivalent to 
 of our money canon freeman thus describes it above as it 
should seem for the entries are very obscure was a canopy of 
considerable extent wrought with bosses internally the whole seems to 
have been surmounted by a figure of our lord with stapledon building 
seems to have been a favourite recreation for though he gave most 
largely both of time and money to the cathedral work he found 
opportunity to build and endow harts hall stapledon innnow exeter 
collegeoxford and the very fair essex house in london in  he 
was created lord high treasurer by edward  and later in the same 
year received from his sovereign the power of holding pleas of hue and 
cry in the lands tenements and fees of the bishopric in the county of 
cornwall the neglected condition of many of the parish churches in his 
diocese distressed him and almost his last public appearance in the 
west of england was at lawhitton where he spoke severely on this matter 
to his dean and chapter and bade them see to it that in future there 
should be no good cause of complaint in the autumn of  he set out 
for france accompanying the young prince edward who was about to do 
homage to the french king for the duchies of aquitaine and poitou but 
his irreproachable integrity made him unpopular and his life was 
threatened on his return to england he saw that a crisis was at hand 
and almost immediately after his arrival queen eleanor landed on the 
coast of suffolk edward  in a brief moment of wisdom assigned to 
the faithful bishop the government of london and retreated to bristol 
but it was too late to effect a reconciliation or prevent a catastrophe 
with a firm hand stapledon endeavoured to restore order and quiet and 
promulgated a decree by which all rebels were excommunicated but the 
citizens wisely perhaps sided with the conquerors and the bishop died 
a martyr to duty the story is well told in the french chronicles quoted 
by dr oliver the bishop of exeter riding towards his inn or hotel 
in eldeaneslane for dinner encountered the mob and hearing them 
shout traitor he rode rapidly to st pauls for sanctuary but was 
unhorsed taken to cheapside stripped and beheaded about the hour of 
vespers the same day october  the choir of st pauls took up the 
headless body of the prelate and conveyed it to st pauls but on 
being informed that he died under sentence the body was brought to st 
clements beyond the temple but was ejected so that the naked corpse 
with a rag given by the charity of a woman was laid on the spot called 
le lawles cherche and without any grave lay there with those of his 
two esquires without office of priest or clerk his house was attacked 
the gates burned quantities of jewels and plate plundered 

in another account of his death it is stated that his head was fixed on 
a long pole by way of trophy that it might be to all beholders a 
lasting memorial of his attempted crime there was a personal reason 
why the bishop was unpopular among the citizens for he procured that 
the justices in eyre should sit in london on which occasion because 
the citizens had committed various offences they were heavily punished 
by the loss of their liberties by pecuniary mulcts and by bodily 
chastisment as they deserved but the queen caused his body to be 
rescued from the hepe of rubische and it was removed to exeter where 
it lies on the north side of the choir he left behind him large sums of 
money and plate a valuable library and unique item ninetyone rings 
he was certainly one of the greatest prelates in english history and 
though he may have been as his detractors asserted fumische and 
without pite he was revered in his diocese and left an example of 
courage and honesty to succeeding generations his executors animated 
by a wish to do what he would have desired distributed    in 
charities and gave considerable sums to other worthy objects and the 
abbot of hartland caused the  of october to be solemnly observed 
out of gratitude for the late bishops bounty and decreed that on that 
day for all future times  pauperes in aula abbatis pro ipsius 
anima pascantur 

to follow so redoubtable a prelate as stapledon must have been an 
extremely difficult task but grandisson who was appointed after 
berkeleys short episcopate ended has sometimes been called the most 
magnificent prelate who ever filled the see he was nominated directly 
by the pope and consecrated by his holiness at avignon his chief glory 
is that he allowed the splendour of the see in no wise to diminish and 
he kept up the stapledon traditions of princely hospitality and 
welldoing his reputation of grave wise and politick seems to have 
been fairly earned as a descendant of the great ducal house of 
burgundy he had lived much with princes and held the position of nuncio 
at the courts of all the mightiest princes of christendom his 
election was carried out in direct opposition to the wishes of the 
canons of exeter but a wise choice had been made and by his long 
episcopate of forty years he gained honour for himself and good fortune 
for his people he had to face many difficulties at first that might 
well have appalled a weaker man the tragic death of stapledon had 
terrified all men the great work of that giant intellect remained 
unfinished and required some one of exceptional energy to complete it 
fitly added to these difficulties the episcopal manors had been 
plundered and the accounts were terribly muddled grandisson luckily 
was a man who looked upon difficulties as things to be overcome he 
applied to the members of his family for funds and the negotiations are 
to his family and subsequently to the diocese at large for funds the 
negotiations are interesting for the borrower is the only person who 
maintained his dignity unimpaired with courteous pertinacity and a 
fitting show of anger he got the supplies he needed with indomitable 
energy he managed to arrange in perfect order the confused affairs of 
his diocese turning eagerly to the task of completing the building of 
his church he transformed the six west bays of the nave vaulting 
aisles west window and north cloister in spiritual and temporal 
affairs he was equally busy twice at least he was the host of royalty 
once the black prince visited his diocese with the captive king of 
france the same illustrious warrior shortly before his death again 
enjoyed the bishops hospitality 

in  grandisson was sent as ambassador to rome and the sound sense 
he had shown at exeter was equally apparent in the conduct of his 
mission so that it was written of him that he did his message with 
much wisdom and honour certainly few bishops have had so exalted a 
view of the dignity and importance of the episcopal office and none 
ever dared to fight more boldly for his imagined rights when the 
archbishop mepham determined to make a personal visitation grandissons 
anger was kindled gathering round him a body of armed retainers he met 
the archbishop at the northwest gate of the close there might have 
been a bloody conflict for neither prelate was likely to give way 
fortunately sober counsels prevailed and the quarrel was referred to 
the pope his holiness decided in grandissons favour and the dispute 
did half break mephams heart and the pope siding with the bishop of 
exeter did break the other half so writes fuller and the quaint 
sentence does not lack authority for the archbishop died shortly after 
the termination of the quarrel 

grandisson remembered his cathedral in his will he bequeathed to his 
successors his crozier and mitre and to the diocese  marks at his 
funeral in accordance with his instructions a hundred poor persons 
were clothed and money was distributed among the prisoners and the sick 
he remembered too the needs of the poorer clergy and the hospitals 
while to pope urban and edward  he left splendid legacies his 
funeral as his life was simple and economical for his magnificent 
presents his gorgeous works on the structure of his church were made 
possible by his own simple almost parsimonious manner of living he was 
buried in the chapel of st radegunde but the tomb was destroyed in 
elizabeths time and his ashes lie no man knows where 

brantyngham the next bishop completed the cloisters the east window 
and west front but as canon freeman has said the rest of the works 
of this and the following century are little else than petty 
restorations of course in a later and inferior style and generally to 
the detriment of the building but there is still much in the history 
of the church and the see that deserves a passing notice under 
brantyngham the old feud that grandisson had finished so satisfactorily 
to himself began again but the victory this time was with the 
archbishop at topsham a village not far from the city the bishops 
servants attacked savagely the archbishops mandatory full of zeal for 
the honour as they conceived it of their own prelate they made the 
wretched creature eat the archbishops writ and seal but the meal of 
parchment and wax did not by any means settle the dispute the bishops 
cause indeed was irretrievably damaged the king was furious an 
appeal to the pope was unsuccessful and brantyngham had to make full 
submission to the offended primate henceforth the archbishops right of 
visitation was not opposed had another than grandisson been bishop in 
mephams day the dispute would never probably have arisen for the 
archbishop was undoubtedly only exercising his rights such visitations 
being according to canon and of ancient usage 

the next bishop whose episcopate is important is lacy who glazed the 
nave windows and raised the chapter house he has too an unique claim 
on our regard because of his saintly character as yet no saint had made 
the cathedral venerable and the sentimental affection and profit which 
saintly relics were wont to cause was still lacking it is said that 
iscanus had contrived to get some relics of becket for his cathedral 
but there was no local saint and this want lacy supplied yet the days 
of his episcopacy were by no means absolutely calm at the very moment 
of his accession he involved himself in a dispute with the city 
corporation as to the liberties of his cathedral nor was he though 
meek and holy at all inclined to submit to any infringement of his 
prerogatives even when the transgressor happened to wear a crown 
indeed he most successfully protested against the conduct of henry  
who held a jail delivery in the bishops hall two men were condemned to 
death but the bishop remonstrated so forcibly against this exercise of 
temporal authority within the precincts of the sanctuary that they were 
released as an author lacy gained a considerable reputation his liber 
pontificalis is still preserved his office in honour of raphael the 
archangel was admired and used in many cathedrals and churches when he 
died miracles were performed at his tomb and pilgrimages were 
constantly made to it by the common people

from this time onward the architectural history of the cathedral becomes 
less important its great periods may thus be summed up  to  
warelwast and marshall built the norman church  to  bronscombe 
and quivil began the decorated work  to  bytton and stapledon 
completed the eastern part  to  grandisson and brantyngham 
completed the nave west front and cloister the fifth and last change 
is the introduction of perpendicular work chiefly noticeable in the 
chapter house the west screen and the great east window the day of 
the great builders was waning fast the old faith that inspired them was 
dwindling the attraction of national concerns was too great for local 
effort moreover the desire to make intricately beautiful right enough 
in itself had vitiated as it was bound to do the taste of architect 
and builder the old norman cathedrals however rugged were imposing in 
their stern and simple strength the desire for decoration affected 
various transformations which at first left the building more beautiful 
and not less strong but gradually the simplicity and strength disappear 
altogether luckily as we shall see the great church of st mary and 
st peter has suffered less than most buildings that have undergone so 
many changes as it is the church of exeter is a remarkable case of 
one general design being carried out through more than a hundred years 
the church is quivils design and the variations though important do 
not seriously detract from it 

the events of the next five hundred years belong more to the history of 
the see and even of england than to the church in the election of 
george neville  we notice the immense value put on noble birth 
only one other reason can be alleged as weighing with those responsible 
for the choice and this reason is so ridiculous as to be almost 
incredible none the less it had doubtless a good deal to do with 
nevilles election to the bishopric he was not only a brother to the 
great earl of warwick but he early showed his intention of keeping up 
the almost kingly traditions of his family here is an account of the 
festivities that took place at oxford after he had performed his 
exercises in the nave of st marys church as the custom now is and 
before was for noblemans sons such entertainment was given for two 
days space that the memory of man being not now able to produce  have 
thought it worth my pains to remember on the first day therefore were 
 messes of meat and on the second  for the entertainment only of 
scholars and certain of the proceeders relations and acquaintances  
later oxford historian asserts that neville was elected chancellor the 
very next year by an appreciative university it is not at all 
unlikely therefore that this display of hospitality had something to 
do with his being chosen bishop as a fitting successor to the office 
once filled by grandisson for four years after his election he was 
unable owing to his youth to be consecrated but by one of those 
ecclesiastical scandals which seem not to have annoyed or astonished 
his contemporaries he was permitted to enjoy the temporalities of the 
see at the age of twentyseven he was fully ordained bishop and a few 
years later was transferred to york during the episcopate of his 
successor bothe the city was besieged by perkin warbeck in  
oliver king who was elected in  was translated to the see of bath 
and wells and to him is due the rebuilding of the abbey church of bath 
which was then ruinous 

from  to  oldham a lancashire man was bishop he built the 
oldham and speke chapels 

veysey who succeeded him lived during the reign of henry  his 
courtly manners made him popular in addition to his rich ecclesiastical 
office he became lord president of wales and tutor to the princess 
mary he founded the town of sutton coleshill now sutton coldfield and 
introduced there the making of kersies on this enterprise he spent the 
larger part of his fortune at the accession of edward  he was left 
undisturbed though suspected of favouring the old religion but when a 
rising in favour of the unreformed church disturbed the western 
counties he was accused of participation in the movement and resigned 
his charge but he retained the temporalities and on marys accession 
was reinstated but he was nearly  years old and soon after died at 
his town of sutton coleshill in  

miles coverdale the translator with tyndale of the bible his 
successor was bishop for only two years he was unpopular although his 
life was most godly and virtuous but the common people says hoker 
whose bottles would receive no new wine could not brook or digest him 
for no other cause but because he was a preacher of the gospel an enemy 
to papistry and a married man this dislike is easily accounted for 
exeter was very far from london the new ideas travelled slowly and the 
west was staunchly conservative as with many reformers too his zeal 
was spoilt by indiscretion the sternness of the puritan militated 
against his success and people preferred the old errors more becomingly 
supported his successor turberville was a man quite after the heart 
of the people and he won praise from protestant and catholic alike 

he was succeeded by william alleyn and as a result of veyseys 
extravagance and henrys greed it may be noticed that by royal charter 
the number of canons was limited to nine 

in  the see was held by joseph hall a man of great distinction 
though too conciliatory to care greatly for lauds policy he wrote a 
justly famous defence of the church of england and her doctrines 
after his translation to norwich he underwent a good deal of 
persecution which he himself has recorded and was for six months a 
prisoner in the tower he is buried in higham parish church his 
monument a skeleton holding in the right hand a bond to death sealed 
and signed debemus morti nos nostrique and in his left the same bond 
torn and cancelled with the endorsement persolvit et quietus est 
fuller says of the famous satirist that he was not unhappy at 
controversies more happy at comments very good in his characters 
better in his sermons best of all in his meditations 

john gauden who became bishop in  was far more fortunate though 
probably not more happy he does not seem to have been over scrupulous 
and his desire for a good manger is unpleasantly obvious but as the 
author of the greek   he is remembered the authorship 
has been disputed but charles  certainly recognized his claim and 
clarendon believed his assertions about it he was clever enough to have 
written even a better book and there is no sufficient ground for 
depriving him of this honour it is certain that he owed his preferment 
to his reputed merit as its author though oddly enough he had taken 
the covenant and preached a notorious sermon against pictures images 
and other superstitions of popery but he publicly recanted later and 
protested against the murder of the king whose supposed last prayers 
and meditations he was skilfully inventing after being in exeter two 
years he was removed to worcester but he had looked to become bishop of 
winchester and it is said that his death was hastened by 
disappointment 

seth ward who followed him had as dean of exeter distinguished 
himself by his zeal and courage he drove from the cathedral precincts 
the buyers and sellers who had encroached thereon and the partition 
wall that divided the cathedral was taken down at his request during 
the commonwealth the building which was now formally called the late 
cathedral church was divided by a brick wall into two places of 
worship known as east peters and west peters the east portion was 
used by the independents and the west by presbyterians ward spent 
 on redeeming the cathedral from the degradation it had suffered 
and bought an organ esteemed the best in england which cost him 
 he was translated to salisbury in  he was a man of 
considerable ability and was a founder of the royal society 

sparrow succeeded to the see in  during his episcopate the grand 
duke cosmo visited exeter and wondered at the worthy bishop his wife 
and his nine children the duke of tuscany was spoken of in the local 
reports as the duke of tuskey and he received from the corporation a 
gift of  or thereabouts sparrow on his translation to norwich 
was succeeded by lamplugh whose political acumen at any rate compels 
admiration if not respect he fervently bade his flock rally round the 
unfortunate james  and then posting to london was rewarded by the 
grateful king with the archbishopric of york he then without any 
compunction crowned william of orange king of england but his 
smartness availed little for within three years continuance of that 
high throne of york he was summoned before an higher macaulay has 
finely described the entrance of the prince into the cathedral as he 
passed under the gorgeous screen that renowned organ scarcely 
surpassed by any of those which are the boast of his native holland 
gave out a peal of triumph he mounted the bishops seat a stately 
throne rich with the carving of the fifteenth century burnet stood 
below and a crowd of warriors and nobles appeared on the right hand and 
on the left the singers robed in white sang the te deum when the 
chaunt was over burnet read the princes declaration but as soon as the 
first words were uttered prebendaries and singers crowded in all haste 
out of the choir at the close burnet in a loud voice cried god 
save the prince of orange and many fervent voices answered amen 
this is certainly the most remarkable as it is also the last of the 
great historical events that have happened under the shadow of the 
cathedral walls there had been nothing to compare with it since the day 
when grandisson with his armed retainers met mepham at the close gate 
three hundred years before offspring blackall is the last bishop we 
need mention he was a famous preacher and worked hard for the comfort 
and education of the indigent classes to him exeter owes her charity 
schools 

of the remaining bishops there is nothing of moment to record 

it has seemed wiser in this brief sketch to devote a paragraph to each 
of those bishops who either architecturally or historically made their 
episcopates events of national importance the early bishops 
especially busied themselves exceedingly in making beautiful their 
principal church it is by knowing something of their lives and times 
that one can best appreciate their labours and trace with intelligent 
interest the causes of the splendid result to be studied minutely in the 
remaining chapters of this book 

moreover all lovers of the great in art all who love what is 
beautiful as all may with a little trouble will not be sorry to have 
even a passing acquaintance with those who have wrought so nobly and 
this short notice of the most famous of the bishops of exeter proves 
that they were for the most part chosen not for their lineage however 
splendid nor the favour they had gained as gracious courtiers but for 
their excellent lives their plain living and high thinking their taste 
and learning and for qualities which if rarer now were not common 
even hundreds of years ago 




     

  


before examining the various details it may be well to recall the 
following facts which have already been referred to first the 
cathedral was saxon and remained so for nearly seventy years then came 
a norman bishop who pulled down the existing building and replaced it by 
the foundations and towers of a finer one for ninetynine years 
sometimes languishingly sometimes vigorously the work continued so 
that by the end of marshalls episcopate  warelwasts noble 
ambition was realized between this date and  the church was 
scarcely touched but a chapter house was built by bishop bruere to god 
and the church of st mary and st peter a sufficient area to make a 
chapter house in our garden near the tower of st john  third style 
early english was then introduced to be followed by the almost 
complete transformation of the entire building into the decorated style 
following on this we get some examples of perpendicular work now this 
series of changes is noticeable in itself and remarkable because it has 
not affected the building in a way that might have been expected the 
first impression indeed that a view of the exterior gives one is that 
it is the result of one design which is largely the case it is only on 
closer inspection that the remnants of the predecorated periods are 
visible the church as professor freeman neatly puts it grew up 
after one general pattern but with a certain advance in detail as the 
work went westward 

the second thing that strikes the visitor is that he has never seen a 
church quite like it it forms a class by itself and can be compared 
with nothing save its own miniature at ottery 

putting aside the saxon cathedral of leofric it is possible to trace 
four distinct styles in what has been wisely called the noblest 
monument of religious zeal of our forefathers in the west of england 
but in discovering these the feeling of wonder increases as the building 
is found to be not a mere jumble but a complete whole though it is 
possible to date the separate parts of the edifice and recognize the 
varying forms of workmanship the architects laboured with so clear an 
understanding of a beautiful result to be attained that there is no 
appearance of patchwork 

the best views of the building are those to be got from a distance in 
some ways this is not without compensation for the cathedral church 
was and is not only splendid as a building but the centre of the 
spiritual life of the diocese it is therefore appropriate that it 
should seem most beautiful to the dwellers in the villages and hamlets 
beyond the city giving them as it were a kind of property in the 
building which they might not have felt had it been less visible 
nearing exeter by train from the plymouth side the noble roof and 
towers are seen above the red houses of the city the site indeed was 
well chosen below the hill on which the city stands are gardens gay 
with flowers and fair apple orchards above there is a blue sky richer 
and deeper than is usual in england on all sides but one stretches the 
beautiful devonshire country meadow hedgerow and wooded hill on that 
side the exe flows rapidly broadening as it goes towards the sea 
southward but a few miles the blue channel waters creep up against the 
yellow sand dunes no cathedral not even lincoln boasts a more lovely 
and appropriate position in the minds of all early christians says 
mr ruskin the church itself was most frequently symbolized under the 
image of a ship there is no country so saturated with traditions of 
the sea as cornwall and devon exe terraout of the earthis 
sometimes declared to be the derivation of the name exeter maybe this 
was only the grateful jest of some seaman who found himself after the 
winter storms gliding up the quiet river with the city walls rising up 
before him yet the remembrance of such western heroes as raleigh and 
drake who bade their followers sit well in order and strike 

the sounding furrows for my purpose holds 
to sail beyond the sunset and the baths 
of all the western stars until   

makes one realize how fit it is that the towers of the cathedral should 
look across the country to the deep waters and be to the mariner as 
the masts of a vessel whereon was safety however fierce the storm

from many parts of the surrounding country fine views may be obtained 
from waddlesdown alphington causeway and many a canal and river bank 

 closer view may seem at first disappointing every writer has echoed 
dr olivers regret that it should be surrounded by dwellinghouses of 
such disparate character but even a nearer survey is with patience 
rewarded the towers exquisitely traceried windows sculptured 
doorways and magnificent roof easily persuade us to forget its mean 
surroundings 

the towersto many these will be the most interesting portion of the 
building the exterior of no other cathedral boasts so unusual a 
feature their position is extraordinary and has given rise to endless 
controversies it has been suggested that they were meant to stand as 
western towers and that the building was to stand east of them and 
that as an afterthought they were converted into transepts but canon 
freeman in his  dismisses this view as merely attractive 
they would certainly be more elaborate he thinks if they had been 
built as western towers but they have neither portal nor ornamental 
work indeed up to more than half their height they have very much the 
appearance of fortresses it may well be that they served as such in 
stephens time for the northern one was severely battered it differs 
somewhat in detail from that on the south side there being an 
interlacing arcade halfway up possibly being so rebuilt when the 
devastation caused by the siege was being repaired there are six stages 
on each tower but only the uppermost four are in any way ornamented 
these have blind arcades and window openings of circular form but the 
details differ slightly on each the turrets at the angles of the 
summits and the battlements were added in the fifteenth century but 
the effect is not inharmonious and the original details are well 
preserved according to an old seventeenthcentury print the north 
tower formerly had an attic with a pyramidal roof this was probably an 
addition when the great bell was first hung see p  the effect of 
these transeptal towers is so fine as to make us regret their rarity  
case in which they were obviously imitated is to be seen in the fine 
parish church of ottery  mary devon there are also most practical 
reasons in their favour and a consideration of them tends to increase 
ones wonder that they should not be found more frequently in the first 
place it is possible to get a continuous uniform stretch of vault the 
roof being broken by no central tower also the plan is simplified and 
nave and choir have more architectural continuity again by building 
transeptal towers and discarding the usual central tower the interior 
escapes a danger it is often hard to overcome the difficulty of holding 
up the central tower it is quite possible that warelwast was farseeing 
enough to anticipate this trouble the histories of other cathedrals 
prove it to be a very real one in  the tower of winchester fell in 
at salisbury the spire is still a constant source of anxiety despite a 
complex arrangement of iron bands and ties which has been reinforced 
more than once the tower of chichester collapsed in  there is a 
legend of the fall of a central tower at christchurch priory and other 
warnings could be cited such as hereford selby peterborough and 
wells 

 architectural history of exeter cathedral by philip 
freeman archdeacon and canon of exeter bell  

originally these two towers were cut off by two arches underneath from 
the body of the church but quivil wishing to enlarge the interior did 
so by throwing the tower spaces into it 

the roof is one of the most striking features of the building 
especially as it is seen from a distance the long line of the ridge of 
nave and choir unbroken by a central tower give it a unique 
distinction amongst english cathedrals the delicate cresting of 
fleursdelis and the pinnacles which crown the supporting buttresses 
obviate any impression of heaviness and together with the long series 
of clerestory windows alike in form yet differing in their admirable 
tracery give a singular impression of beauty 

the north porchthis was the northern entrance of the norman church 
and from the outside it is possible to trace the line where the 
fifteenthcentury front was added to the old structure it is decorated 
with seven canopied niches in the style of that period these however 
remained vacant until  when they were filled with statues by mr 
 read of exeter representing the patron saints of england and the 
allies st george st denys st joseph  cyril and methodius st 
vladimir and st ambrose the roof is vaulted and on the central boss 
is a finelycarved agnus dei within a recess of the eastern wall are 
three headless figures representing in the centre the crucifixion 
st mary and st john standing on either side over the inside doorway 
is a niche that probably once held a figure of the virgin

the west front is one of the features which gives a peculiar character 
to this cathedral in the wealth of imagery on the projecting screen 
which forms the lowest stage of the front it is second only to wells 
amongst english cathedrals the actual west wall of the church is the 
work of bishop grandisson who formed on the south side of the central 
doorway the small chapel of st radegunde as a burial place for himself 
the greater part of the end wall of the nave is filled by a large window 
with remarkably beautiful tracery in its head the date must be about 
 above this is a battlemented parapet sloped at each end to follow 
the lines of the aisleroofs above this parapet appears the gable of 
the main roof in which is inserted a triangular window with elegant 
tracery lighting the space between the vault and outer roof at the 
apex of the gable is a niche containing a small statue of st peter 

the screen which forms the lowest stage of this front must have been 
finished in brantynghams time though it seems probable that it was 
designed if not begun by grandisson it contains eightyeight figures 
in three rows representing angels warriors kings and saints their 
costume and armour are characteristic of the fashions of richard iis 
reign the lowest row consists of angelic figures each sustaining a 
triple pilaster with capitals on these capitals stand the statues of 
the second row a long line of knights and kings above which are the 
angels and apostles of the third row above the third row stand two 
figures said to represent athelstan and edward the confessor the 
former once drove out the britons from the city the latter as we know 
founded the bishopric 

this group of statues has been the subject of a monograph by miss  
prideaux who shows that the intention was to symbolize the heavenly 
jerusalem where angels saints and monarchs unite to honour the 
enthroned saviour and his blessed mother who as representative of the 
church triumphant is being crowned by her son the coronation of the 
virgin was depicted in the central group immediately over the great 
doorway the figures being those of st peter our lady our lord and 
st paul at some unknown date the statue of the virgin was destroyed 
and a figure intended to represent richard  was substituted in  
two other figures assigned to james the less and king william  are 
modern reproductions by alfred stevens some new heads were also added 
many circumstances have combined with the action of time to injure these 
sculptures but the general effect is rich if somewhat heavy above the 
screen is a platform from which the bishop probably blessed the people 
and the minstrels welcomed with song the approach of royal or 
illustrious visitors 

the three doorways in the screen are worthy of notice being richly 
decorated that on the south side is the most beautiful and contains 
two fine pieces of sculpture one generally declared to be an angel 
appearing to joseph in a dream the other certainly recording the 
adoration of the shepherds the central porch is decorated with 
sculptured foliage and the crucifixion is exhibited on the central boss 
of the groined roof tracery

fine as is the exterior the interior of the building is quite as 
beautiful restoration of an unusually careful and discreet style has 
done much to revive the deteriorated splendours of the place sixty 
years ago the nave was filled with hideous and cumbersome pews and such 
work as had been done towards keeping the place in repair was in the 
worst possible taste but a change has been wrought of the happiest kind 
in recent years so that no cathedral in the country can boast a more 
admirable interior 

it has been the custom to deplore the lack of elevation and its lowness 
has compelled comparisons with the cathedrals of france but this 
objection is surely rather trivial for though the long vaulted roof 
uninterrupted the whole length of the building might tend to take away 
from the appearance of height the work on the roof itself the delicate 
ornaments on capitals and windows do much to atone for this effect to 
the ordinary visitor it may safely be asserted lack of height will 
only be obvious when pointed out to him 

the navelittle of the norman masonry is now to be seen yet it is 
clear that when marshall completed warelwasts design he found the nave 
finished to quote canon freeman whose book too technical for the 
general public is of incalculable value to the student on the 
interior face of both north and south walls of the nave aisles 
disturbances of masonry occurring at regular intervals indicate the 
position of a series of norman pilasters the base of one of them having 
recently been found in situ beneath the stone seat outside and 
corresponding to the position of each several pilaster may be observed 
either flat buttresses of norman form and masonry or else traces of 
their removal these remains linking together the obviously norman 
towers and the massive west wall point to the conclusion that the 
norman cathedral as marshall found it included the entire nave 

when the changes began the fabric rolls if they do not entirely 
desert us give us but meagre help so that the exact date and cost of 
each detail is only to be guessed at stapledon probably intended as 
early as  to begin the work of recasting the nave in that year he 
made purchases of  great poplar trees bought for scaffolds and  
alder trees further entries tell us of seven and eightpence worth of 
timber bought by the bishop at london and  great trees from 
langford the work hitherto attempted by stapledon did not demand an 
outlay of this kind so though grandisson gets the honour of having 
finished the nave something is due to stapledon for having given the 
initiative the large balances of the preceding nine years had left a 
great sum of money in the latters hands and a donation of stapledons 
further increased that balance by the substantial sum of  in 
january  is a record of william canons bill for marble he had 
been commissioned to furnish he had agreed to supply the purbeck 
pillars for the nave receiving   for eleven large columns and 
 apiece for bases and capitals this is one of the most interesting 
items we have of the building and cost of the cathedral and occurs 
fortunately at a time when such information is unusually scanty in 
addition to the abovementioned purbeck marble stone from the quarries 
of caen in normandy and other places nearer home was procured in large 
quantities in  the bishop gave permission to the dean and chapter 
to obtain from his agents at chudleigh twelve suitable oaks from his 
wood there about  the building of the nave was completed it was 
extensively restored in recent years under the guidance of sir gilbert 
scott the purbeck columns had fallen into a most dilapidated state and 
were carefully repaired the material used being obtained from those 
spots which had supplied the original builders 

the view of the nave as one enters the west door is most impressive its 
full height of seventy feet is not dwarfed by the unhindered stretch of 
roof the groined and ribbed roof itself is of marvellous beauty and 
springs from slender vaulting shafts of which the bosses are 
exquisitely carved with a strange mixture of religious and legendary 
figures foliage and animals the artists seem to have ransacked the 
whole universe for subjects and to have interpreted their ideas with 
great cunning the corbels that support the vaulting shafts are equally 
elaborately carved

they consist of figures and foliage and the variety of subjects chosen 
is no less surprising than the skill the artists have shown in the 
realization of their ideas whether they are peculiar to exeter or not 
it may be safely said that one could not easily find their equals either 
in design or execution the subjects treated are too numerous for 
detailed treatment in this place but the carving of vines and acorns 
and oakleaves will be readily admired

the nave has seven bays and the arcades are supported by clustered 
pillars of purbeck marble showing various tints of blue and grey there 
are sixteen shafts in each pier corresponding with the eight subordinate 
mouldings in each pair of arches and the diagonal position of each 
cluster adds much to its graceful appearance in the retrochoir there 
are earlier examples of this kind of pier showing how the builders 
experimented with the grouping of the shafts before they attained the 
perfect proportions of the pillars in the nave and choir it seems that 
they utilized the norman pillars as the central core round which to 
group the purbeck shafts the triforium in groups of four arches is 
unusually low and rests on small clustered columns broken in one place 
only on the north side to make way for the minstrels gallery 

the minstrels gallerythis is the most beautiful gallery of its 
kind to be found in england its twelve decorated niches containing 
figures of musicians the musical instruments represented include the 
cittern bagpipe hautboy crowth harp trumpet organ guitar 
tambour and cymbals with two others which are uncertain the tinted 
figures of the angels standing out against an orangecoloured 
backgroundeach in a separate niche with an elaborately carved 
canopyplaying upon the various instruments are admirably carved and 
most graceful in form and arrangement the two niches on either side of 
the gallery contained figures of st mary and st peter the niches are 
supported by corbelled heads of edward  and queen philippa edward 
 created the black prince duke of cornwall in  and made the city 
of exeter part of the duchy the city according to izacke being 
held of the said duke as parcel of the dutchy by the fee farm rent of 
twenty pounds per ann to this connexion has been traced the erection 
of the gallery for such duchies were territorial realities and the 
prince would be received by minstrels chaunting in the gallery whenever 
he paid a visit to his feudal dependency it is asserted that it was 
first used after the battle of poictiers when the black prince brought 
with him to england visiting exeter en route for london the captured 
french king but professor freeman thinks the duke did not pay a visit 
to exeter at that time and that local tradition refers really to a 
later date when he came home as a sick man not long before his death 

the lofty character of the clerestory above the gallery and set 
somewhat farther back is remarkable the tracery of all the windows is 
of the best type of the fourteenth century and is unrivalled by that of 
any other english cathedral of similar date in their main features the 
opposite windows are alike though they vary in detail

st radegundes chapelon the south side of the main entrance and 
within the thickness of the western wall is the chapel of st radegunde 
one of the most interesting in the cathedral as early as  a deed 
belonging to the chapter makes mention of this chapel within st 
peters cemetery and is dated in the mayoralty of one turbest and 
attested by the then bishop simon de apulia grandisson in accordance 
with the custom of his day while completing the work of transforming 
the cathedral looked out for a suitable place of burial for himself he 
chose this chapel and in  the fabric rolls contain a reference to 
the glazing of the windows and the better securing of them with nine 
bars of iron in accordance with a clause in his will corpus vero meum 
volo quod sepeliatur extra ostium occidentale ecclesiae exon ita 
celeriter sicut fieri poterit his remains were placed under the low 
arch in the east of the chapel here they lay for many years but in the 
later years of elizabeth apparently without creating any public 
indignation his tomb was rifled and his ashes scattered to the four 
winds there seems to be no good reason why religious fanaticism should 
have caused the tomb of so great and good a man to be despoiled two 
interesting details are the carved figure of christ on the roof and the 
holes in the stones from which the lamps were formerly hung 

st edmunds chapel in the northwest corner of the nave was part of 
the norman church and was incorporated in his new work by bishop 
grandisson in it is a large font of modern gothic style presented in 
the nineteenth century by archdeacon bartholomew 

the fontat the southwest side of the nave stands the 
chaliceshaped font of white marble purposely made in  for the 
baptism of henrietta anne youngest child of charles  afterwards 
duchess of orleans who was born in exeter during the parliamentary 
wars the font is said to have been made in a fortnight which may 
account for the inferior character of the sculpture but if not of 
artistic merit it is certainly of historic interest and after being 
set aside for some years was replaced in its present position in  
and is now always used for baptisms 

the patteson pulpit was placed in the nave in  it is of mansfield 
stone and is a beautiful example of modern sculpture the panels 
represent the martyrdom of st alban the embarkation of st boniface 
and his companions for germany and the natives of nukapu melanesia 
placing the body of bishop patteson in a canoe the martyred bishop is 
shown wrapped in a native mat a relic still preserved in his family 


    

the great west window was filled with stained glass in  in 
commemoration of dr temple bishop of exeter  of london  and 
in  archbishop of canterbury figures in the lower lights represent 
the most notable bishops of exeter from leofric to frederick temple 

the monument under the west window commemorates services and losses of 
the  battalion of the duke of cornwalls light infantry which as 
the  regiment greatly distinguished itself during the sepoy revolt 
in india in  

on the northwest is a mural tablet with medallion portrait 
commemorating richard blackmore the author of lorna doone  
the three lights of the small window above are filled with stained glass 
in connexion with this memorial the corresponding window on the south 
side was filled with stained glass by dean cowie 

the largest monument in the north aisle is that to the memory of 
officers and men of the  lancers who fell during long and 
distinguished service in india 

farther on is a large brass of no particular merit to the memory of 
the men of the  battalion of the north devon regiment who fell in the 
afghan war of  it is surmounted by two regimental flags 

above a mural tablet to lieutenant  allen is a window of stained 
glass erected to the memory of the  earl of devon the colour scheme 
is particularly good and the design representing jacobs dream is not 
unsuccessful 

 plain tablet to the memory of samuel sebastian wesley the famous 
musician is the only other monument in the aisle of general interest 

in the same aisle have recently been placed the colours of those 
battalions of the devons who served in the great european war  

to complete the examination of the nave we must cross to the south 
aisle in the first bay of which is the ancient doorway probably built 
by bishop bruere leading into the cloister at the end of the aisle is 
the monument of colonel john macdonald who died in  a son of the 
celebrated flora macdonald the most eastern window of the aisle is 
filled with stained glass representing four bishops of the courtenay 
family peter courtenay bishop of exeter will be recognized as he 
holds the great peter bell his gift to the cathedral which hangs in 
the north tower he is the bishop alluded to by shakespeare richard 
 act iv sc

sir edward courtenay and the haughty prelate 
bishop of exeter his elder brother 
with many more confederates are in arms 

after the accession of henry  he was translated to winchester

formerly there was a courtenay chantry in the last bay of this aisle 
corresponding with bishop brantynghams chantry on the north side these 
became ruinous and were removed early in the nineteenth century the 
courtenay tomb in the south transept is entirely a restoration the 
effigies represent sir hugh courtenay  earl of devon and margaret 
de bohun his wife the great brass of their son sir peter courtenay 
also formerly in the chantry is now in the south choir aisle it has 
been sadly injured by being trodden under foot for many hundred years 
and is now protected by matting he was standard bearer to edward  
and richard  and one of the first knights of the garter 

the centre window of the south nave aisle is filled with stained glass 
in memory of those of the devon regiment who served in the south african 
war  the tablets with their names are in st edmunds chapel 
their flags hang on either side of the window 

the large brass tablet though like too many of the memorials in the 
nave unnecessarily large and far from meritorious in design is not 
without interest it is to the memory of majorgeneral howard 
elphinstone  who was drowned off ushant in  

above a tablet of brass to hugh  earl of devon and his wife is a 
window erected by sir edwin watkin to the memory of thomas latimer the 
small window to the left erected by dean cowie in memory of his wife 
should be noticed 

north transeptwe have already seen that the two great towers of the 
cathedral were in their nature transeptal from the beginning but they 
were quite separated from the body of the church the arches connecting 
them being filled in with strongly built masonry forming a complete 
wall but quivil wishing to enlarge the interior of the building took 
down these walls and he set about altering the arches and converting 
them into the same decorated style to match this work in the rest of the 
building he also altered and transformed the norman chapels that 
projected on the east side of each transept in the north transept one 
window and two narrow doorways still betray their norman origin the 
open galleries in each transept are connected by a passage with the 
clerestory this too is quivils work and his windows in the two 
chapels of st john and st paul easily distinguishable by their 
wheelshape are interesting 

here is chantrys fine statue of the devonshire artist northcote and a 
tablet to the memory of the men and officers of the  devon 
regiment who fell in the crimea visitors will notice with interest a 
fairly successful mural painting representing the resurrection the 
soldiers in armour being drawn with considerable spirit 

sylke chantry is in the north transept sylke was a person of 
considerable importance in his day and one who deserved and obtained no 
little honour from his contemporaries he administered the affairs of 
the diocese as vicargeneral during the absence of bishop courtenay and 
also during that of bishop fox in  he was made precentor and held 
that office till his death the priests grateful for the efforts he had 
made to further their comfort decided to keep his obit the abbot and 
convent of st mary of cleeve in somersetshire willing to show their 
sense of obligation to him and canon moore gave yearly to the dean and 
chapter the sum of    to be spent in celebrating their 
anniversary sylkes tomb represents a very ghostly figure with the 
epitaph sum quod eris fueram quod es pro me precor ora the 
chantry is in the style of the later gothic and is one of those final 
touches to the cathedral archdeacon freeman esteems so happily imparted 
to it the ancient works of the thirteenthcentury clock upon the north 
wall have been placed in this chantry the machinery being in motion 
though it does not now work any part of the actual clock the various 
parts are of different dates the oldest wheel has been working more or 
less regularly for about  years the dial represents the sun and moon 
revolving round the earth in the centre the varying phases of the moon 
being indicated 

st pauls chapel is on the east side of the north transept 
attributed to the time of marshall or his immediate predecessors on the 
tiles are the arms of henry iiis brother richard of cornwall who was 
elected king of the romans it is used as a vestry for the lay choral 
vicars 

south transeptopening from the east wall is the chapel of st john 
the baptist it corresponds with that of st paul in the north 
transept some of the glass in the windows was placed there at the 
restoration of  the screen dividing it from the transept is 
oldhams work the chapel is now furnished for private meditation and 
prayer

chapel of the holy ghostthis one of the most ancient parts of the 
cathedral lies between the south tower and chapter house it occupies 
the place of the passage known as the slype in monastic churches the 
plain stone barrel roof should be noted it is now used as the 
choristers vestry 

the south transept contains a very interesting collection of monuments 

monuments in south transepton the east wall a shallow recess in 
which are set some fragments of sculpture is traditionally described as 
the tomb of leofric first bishop of exeter hoker thus tells the story 
this leofricus died an  and was buried in the cemetery or 
churchyard of his own church under a simple or broken marble stone 
which place by the since enlarging of his church is now within the 
south tower of the same where of late anno  a new monument was 
erected to the memory of so good worthy  noble a personage by the 
industry of the writer hereof but at the charges of the dean  chapter 

in the corner at the southeast is the grave of bishop john the 
chaunter who died in  he was for thirty years precentor of the 
cathedral and was consecrated bishop by baldwin archbishop of 
canterbury preacher and pilgrim of the crusade and a native of 
exeter bishop john assisted at the coronation of richard  he held the 
see for six years 

sir peter carew whose mural tablet is a conspicuous feature was buried 
at waterford in ireland he is one of the most distinguished members of 
an ancient western family on the whitsunday of  the village of 
samford courtenay rose in revolt against the new prayerbook that edward 
 had ordered to be used in the churches and the whole diocese 
speedily followed the lead the people swore that they would keep the 
old and ancient religion as their forefathers before them had done sir 
gawain carew sir peter carew and sir thomas dennis the sheriff were 
busy in stemming the tide of rebellion efforts at compromise were 
useless the people bitterly demanded the old religion and called the 
new form of worship a christian game while the cornishmen declared 
that they since certain of us understand no english utterly refuse 
the new english early in july the malcontents set siege to exeter the 
wealth of the civic dignitaries stimulated the besiegers who summoned 
the city to surrender three times vowing that they would enter by 
force and take the spoil of it were their demands refused there was 
discontent and plotting within the walls and food gave out many were 
eager to let in the rebels and hoker records that but two days before 
the delivery of the city the malcontents paraded the streets crying 
out come out these heretics and twopenny bookmen where be they by 
gods wounds and blood we will not be pinned in to serve their turn we 
will go out and have in our neighbours they be honest good and godly 
men but the principal citizens though nurtured in the old faith held 
out grimly for the king the siege was raised by john lord russell 
whom sir peter had hastily summoned from hinton st george in 
somersetshire food was supplied to the city by the special industry 
and travels of a thousand welshmen under sir william herbert sir 
peter on his arrival in london was threatened with hanging by the lord 
protector as having caused the commotion by burning the barns at 
crediton he pleaded the kings letter under his hand and privy signet 
but he escaped with difficulty though he obtained from lord russell the 
lands of winislacre as a reward later on he opposed queen marys 
marriage with the king of naples and as fuller puts it this active 
gentleman had much adoe to expedite himself and save his life being 
imprisoned for his compliance with sir thomas wyate he lived an 
active reckless life to the last closing his career by some signal 
service in ireland he was a brother of the earl of totnes the 
handsome elizabethan monument is to sir john gilbert brother of the 
more famous humphrey and his wife elizabeth chudleigh he was one of 
the merchant adventurers and a halfbrother of raleigh his relations 
with exeter were very friendly the merchants being keenly interested in 
maritime discoveries for they hoped in far away asia to get a new 
market for their cloth 

heroes of later days are not forgotten in this gallant company and a 
tablet on the east wall commemorates the men of the  regiment 
cornwall light infantry who fell in the indian mutiny the colours of 
the regiment show the names of waterloo and lucknow

the choir screenthis is the work of bishop stapledon and was 
probably completed about  the dean and chapter anticipated the 
admiration which this screen would cause in after ages and we read that 
they presented william canon the executor of the marble work  out 
of their courtesy high above the screen as we learn from the fabric 
rolls the rood with mary and john rested on an iron bar 

illustration     
    

the paintings within the panels above the beautifully carved spandrils 
have little interest or merit though it is thought that they date from 
the same period as the screen itself it is difficult however to 
believe that they can be so old or that such good and bad work could 
belong to the same period james  introduced into the foliage of the 
spandrils the rose and thistle but this uncalledfor emendation was 
summarily removed in the year  the side arches of the screen were 
at one period filled up with thick walls and two strong doors barred 
the arch of entrance but this was altered by the restorers in  

the organ was originally built by john loosemore about  in its 
existing form it is an enlarged reconstruction by messrs willis the 
old instrument being incorporated in it as a choirorgan the organ 
case which was an elegant specimen of renaissance woodwork has also 
undergone alteration and renovation 

the choirif the chief glory with regard to the exterior of the 
cathedral remains undoubtedly with the designer and builder of the great 
towers the choir the work of bytton and stapledon is no less 
certainly the supreme glory of the interior the norman choir reached no 
farther than the third bay counting from the choir screen traces 
recently discovered seem to prove that it had an apsidal termination 
bishop marshall in completing warelwasts work added four bays and 
destroyed the triple apse it is also possible that as the transition 
period to early english was in its birth some of the vaulting was 
pointed bytton converted the choir as left by marshall into the 
decorated style inspired to the work by the success which had attended 
quivils efforts in the easternmost bay of the nave the whole workthe 
transformation of the choir with its aislestook about fifteen years to 
complete the speed and skill with which it was accomplished being due 
to the fact that the task was not entirely in the hands of one body of 
labourers it seems to have been divided into two portions at which the 
builders worked simultaneously admirable as quivils work in the nave 
had been that of bytton in the choir is an improvement doubtless he 
had learnt something from the difficulties his predecessor encountered 
and knew how to avoid them at any rate he pushed forward the work with 
great vigour and boldness he formed his pillars of horizontal sections 
of purbeck marble from nine to fifteen inches thick five boutelles on 
each side presenting the appearance of twentyfive shafts bound in 
one in the pavement of the choir more than ten thousand tiles were 
used for the vaulting of the choir also his work though the honour 
due to him has till lately been denied he procured quantities of 
portland stone material for bases and capitals was imported also from 
portland the entry in the fabric rolls runs for the purchase of  
great blocks of stone at portland for the keys or bosses together with 
 bases and capitals including carriage by sea    the colouring 
of the keystones was due to stapledon in the first year of his 
episcopate

between  and  the choir underwent very extensive repairs for 
the most part they were successful and if in particular instances 
objection may be taken it would be hypercriticism to detract from 
their value wherever possible the stone was taken from the quarries 
used by the first builders the purbeck marbles especially had severely 
suffered and the mouldings and bases ruthlessly destroyed for the 
better accommodation of the wainscoting to the stalls moreover the 
differences in the nature of the stone were rendered null by a hideous 
yellow wash with which they had been lavishly besprinkled during the 
restoration the corbels and roofbosses were cleaned and carefully 
repaired these though of the same character as those in the nave are 
both richer and more varied in design and more skilfully carved 

the choir stallsthe stalls are entirely modern and the work of sir 
gilbert scott originally no doubt they were similar in style to the 
bishops throne one of the most admirable of stapledons additions to 
the cathedral they were probably surmounted with canopies with an open 
arcade of stone behind them the modern designer has so constructed his 
stalls as to bear out this idea since as far as possible they are meant 
to replace the earlier ones the misericords of bishop bruere have been 
placed beneath the seats these misericords have not their equal in 
england they are richly carved representing foliage wild beasts an 
elephant men fighting others playing musical instruments and 
legendary monsters the introduction of an elephant proves that these 
misericords were not completed until after brueres death in  the 
elephant having been first brought into england in  there is also a 
representation of a knight in a swanboat showing that the legend of 
lohengrin was known in england 

the reredosthis too is modern work and most successfully has 
earp carried out the designs of sir gilbert scott it is of alabaster 
inlaid with agate carnelian and jasper in the centre of the three 
compartments into which it is divided is the ascension the other two 
groups representing the descent of the holy ghost and the 
transfiguration as the work has met with considerable opposition it is 
well to remember archdeacon freemans words he having the best of all 
rights to speak with its delicate canopies of alabaster and 
sculptures wrought in bold relief its inlay of choice marbles its 
redundance of costly stones and its attendant angel figures it 
enshrines a multitude of ideas well harmonizing with its place and 
purpose the ancient altar of stapledons has long since disappeared 
this was mostly of silver the mensa only being of marble in the 
monument of leofric erected by hoker the historian was found a large 
slab of marble marked with crosses this possibly was a portion of 
stapledons altar destroyed by an order in council  see below p 
 

the bishops throne was stapledons work erected in  it is 
notable for not having a single nail in it being entirely fixed 
together with wooden pegs this magnificent sheaf of carved oak as it 
has been called rises to the height of fiftyseven feet the carving 
shows foliage and finials of great beauty and beneath the canopies are 
angel figures bearing the insignia of the bishops office on one side 
the chalice and host of blessing on the other the bell book and 
candle that conveyed the bishops curse 

at the date of the  restorations the throne was in a very defective 
state it had been covered with brown paint and the lower panels were 
not a little damaged there are traces of ancient colouring still but 
only the paintings at the base have been renovated which commemorate 
the quartette of famous bishops warelwast quivil stapledon and 
grandisson and were no doubt somewhat later than the throne itself 
originally the niches of the tabernacle work were filled with figures 
but these have disappeared

the sediliait is natural after an examination of the throne in wood 
to turn to stapledons equally splendid achievement in stone the 
sedilia were most carefully restored under sir gilbert scott there are 
three arches each ten feet high of openwork above which is a rich 
display of tabernacle work the niches once contained statues for the 
sockets are visible the carving extraordinarily skilful and intricate 
consists of leaves and animals heads like much of the carving in the 
cathedral that is attributed to this date it was the work of de 
montacute a french artist the seats are divided by metal shafts the 
terminal divisions being supported by lions it has been contended that 
these lions are of considerably earlier date than the rest of the work 
but there is no evidence to go upon except a fancied resemblance to 
early english work there seems no reason why stapledon should not have 
chosen lions as a fitting decoration and carved them in a style more or 
less traditional three small heads are carved on the back of the 
sedilia the centre one being that of leofric and on either side the 
heads of edward the confessor and his wife eadgytha it will be 
remembered that they were present with their whole court at the 
installation of leofric the central seat is known as leofrics stone 
on which he is traditionally said to have sat and there is an entry in 
the year  recording that twenty pence was paid for writing on the 
stone of my lord leofric 

on the triforium arcading just over the sedilia the heads of leofric 
edward and eadgytha are repeated 

the decoration of the choir vault is by messrs clayton and bell the 
attempt to give life to the roofing by gilding the bosses and painting 
the ribs red and blue and gold while the ground colour is a dull white 
is not without merit

st james chapelin the aisle on the south of the choir in the 
north aisle immediately opposite is the companion chapel of st andrew 
it will be noticed how frequently one part balances another throughout 
the building these chapels are partly marshalls work when the apsidal 
chapels were pulled down at the time the apse was destroyed marshall 
built the present chapels of st james and st andrew bronscombe 
altered them considerably and the first item in the fabric rolls is 
for  windows for st james chapel   for glass  this is the 
last year of bronscombes episcopate and proves he had at any rate 
almost finished the renovation of this chapel the most noticeable 
features are the upper chamber and the magnificent but halfdestroyed 
monument popularly known as leofrics tomb the chapel contained two 
altars one dedicated to st james and the other probably to st thomas 
of canterbury 

nearly opposite this chapel are the effigies of two knights dating from 
the fourteenth century their crosslegged attitude leading to the 
erroneous notion that they were crusaders they probably represent 
humphrey de bohun father of margaret wife of hugh courtenay  and 
sir arthur chichester of raleigh  old histories describe armorial 
bearings painted on their shields but these have long since perished 

st andrews chapelopposite to and corresponding with that of st 
james it was marshalls work originally like its fellow chapel being 
a substitute for one of the old apsidal chapels of the norman choir 
stapledon completed the renovations so as to make it a parallel to 
bronscombes restored chapel of st james the detached shafts are 
clearly an imitation of the earlier bishops work the chapel contains 
an upper chamber formerly used as a muniments room the chapel 
originally contained altars to st andrew and st catherine in  is 
an order of byttons that chantry services should be held here for 
andrew de kilkenny late dean and others among the names we find that 
of henry de kilkenny who was at the time of byttons order still 
living and a canon of the cathedral 

illustration       
    

the ambulatorybetween the high altar and the lady chapel is the 
ambulatory it is noticeable that the shafts differ from those in other 
parts of the building the north and south windows are of the time of 
bishop bruere thirteenth century the architecture throughout the 
retrochoir is early decorated 

two old oak bibleboxes are attached one to each pillar though ugly 
and clumsy they are distinctly interesting 

the windows are modern and excellent messrs clayton and bell have 
seldom done anything better the colours are quite admirable and well 
blended two monuments of jacobean work are well worthy of attention 
concerning the subject of one jacob railard there is nothing to be 
learnt but the other john bidgood was one of the most accomplished 
and beneficial physicians of his age and was born in  he was 
deprived of his fellowship at exeter college in  for drinking of 
healths to the confusion of reformers like many another good man he 
had to suffer for his loyalty he obtained his doctors degree at padua 
and won a great reputation as a skilful and humane practitioner with 
the restoration he obtained his oxford degree but continued to practise 
in his native city he died in his sixtyeighth year 

at the north end of the ambulatory is spekes chantry also called st 
georges chapel it is of late and exceedingly rich perpendicular 
work oliver notices that in  the east window and altar were 
destroyed to make a passage into the great church of st 
petersintheeast partitioned from west peters by a brick wall 
erected plastered and whitened on both sides by walter deeble at the 
expense of  the effigy of sir john speke rests in the chapel the 
carving behind the figure is very elaborate his home was at white 
lackington in somersetshire and he was the owner of brampford speke 
near exeter to secure the observance of his and his wifes obit he 
endowed the chapel with the lands tenements and hereditaments in 
langford frehead and ashill in somersetshire 

the north window is to the memory of archdeacon bartholomew and was 
placed here in

at the other end of the ambulatory is bishop oldhams chantry 
dedicated to our saviour it was richly restored by bishop oldham who 
also restored the spekeor st georgechantry immediately opposite it 
is to this bishop we owe the delicate and elegant screening which 
imparts distance and veiling to all nine chapels and to prior sylkes 
chantry in the north transept the walls and vaulting are richly 
decorated and the panelling and rebus at the northeast corner contain 
a rebus on the bishops name ouldom being decorated with owls in 
accordance with his object in restoring the chapel his body was buried 
there and his effigy lies in a niche of the south wall oldham was a 
part founder of corpus christi college oxford by whose orders the 
chapel was restored some years ago he settled the arms of the 
seegules a sword erect in pale argent pommelled and hilted or 
surmounted with two keys in saltire of the last he was a native of 
manchester founded the grammar school there and held the post of 
warden he was a man of very methodical habits according to hoker he 
dined regularly at eleven and supped at five to ensure precision he 
had a house clock to strike the hours and a servant to look after it 
should his lordship be prevented by important business from coming to 
table at the appointed time the servant would delay the clocks 
striking the hour until he knew that his master was ready sometimes if 
asked what was the hour he would humorously answer as your lordship 
pleaseth at which the bishop would smile and go away 

the lady chapelit has been suggested that this chapel occupies the 
site of the choir in the old cathedral of leofric the earliest mention 
of it is in a deed of bishop brueres in  it was remodelled by 
bronscombe and quivil but the two pointed arches with solid 
pierstotally different from any others in the cathedraldividing the 
chapel from the side chapels though their moulding has been altered 
very considerably in order to tally with a later style show evidence of 
much earlier date the shafts are of purbeck marble and the windows 
arranged as in the nave contain the last importation of glass from 
abroad save that in the transeptal windows used in the cathedral the 
bosses in the eastern bay with the evangelists emblems and head of 
christ should be noticed the elaborate fourteenth century reredos is 
the work of grandisson the central niche contained a figure of the 
virgin before which a lamp was suspended the sedilia and double 
piscina on the south side are interesting 

the lady chapel contains several monumental tombs of interest beneath 
the arches conducting to the side chapels are the effigies of bishops 
bronscombe and stafford 

bronscombe died in  stafford in  but with a regard to 
symmetry which is conspicuous in the cathedral the earlier effigy of 
bronscombe was raised and provided with a new canopy to correspond with 
staffords tomb on the opposite side bronscombe lies on the south side 
at the entrance to or the north side of his chapel of st gabriel the 
colouring on the effigy must have been uncommonly splendid and even the 
remnants of the patterns have not faded out of all beauty 

illustration    
    

staffords tomb is on the north side at the entrance to the chapel of 
st mary magdalen it has had to contend with severer enemies than old 
age but shockingly as the effigy has suffered it still preserves 
something of its original beauty and stateliness the attitude is 
simple the gloved hands of the bishop are joined over his breast in an 
attitude of prayer the face is thin and ascetic its saintly austerity 
being rendered more noticeable owing to the rich mitre that crowns the 
head the folds of the robe are managed with a consummate simplicity and 
skill in lelands itinerary the bishops epitaph is preserved

tomb of sir john and lady doddridgesir john doddridge came of an 
old devonshire family for in  one walter doddridge and his wife 
surrendered to the dean and chapter of exeter a right of entrance into 
the close from their house in high street fuller says of him that it 
were hard to say whether he was better artist divine cure or common 
lawyer though he fixed on the last for his publick profession he was 
second justice of the kings bench and gained great renown as a judge 
of stern integrity sir john was three times married the lady whose 
effigy is here represented being his third wife dorothy daughter of 
sir amias bampfylde she died in  sir john who became a judge of 
the kings bench lived till  he won the nickname of the sleepy 
judge for he always closed his eyes in court the better to keep his 
attention fixed on the case the monument is very elaborate and if not 
beautiful is well worth attention on account of its technical qualities 
and the probable accuracy of its representation the dress of lady 
dorothy doddridge exhibits a good example of costume the skirt 
embroidered with pansies and carnations the ruff and cuffs showing old 
devonshire bone lace it was no doubt copied from one of the ladys 
actual gowns 

on the south side of the lady chapel are two most interesting monuments 
of early bishops that towards the east has been assigned to bartholomew 
iscanus  but in all probability it represents one of his far 
earlier predecessors the sculpture is almost archaic in style the 
mitre low the face bearded and the type extraordinarily byzantine the 
left hand holds the pastoral staff the point of which impales a winged 
dragon with a sphinxlike head at his feet in the angles of the 
archway at the tomb are the figures of two angels with censers 

the other tomb is that of simon de apulia d  it presents a great 
contrast to that just described the great advance made in the art of 
sculpture is noticeable in the more human character of the face which 
is clean shaven and the more skilful management of the hands the 
artist too seems to have courted difficulties for the bishops robe 
and mitre are richly jewelled and the foliage and animal at his feet 
though conventional are most elaborately designed

bishop peter quivil  tombstone in the centre of the 
pavement was restored here in  on the representation of mr john 
jones of franklyn the cross and letters were recut under his 
directions the epitaph is petra tegit petrum nihil officiat sibi 
tetrum and westcott in his view of devon writes which verse was 
written in an ancient character each letter distant from the other at 
least four inches so that this short verse supplied the whole large 
circumference and cost me some labour in finding out and reading it 

certainly this is one of the most interesting memorials in the 
cathedral indeed it may be well considered the most interesting for 
it is dedicated to the man by whose genius the whole great design was 
begotten its simplicity is noteworthy but quivil required no elaborate 
sepulture the cathedral itself is his mighty monument since it was he 
who founded

st gabriels chapelthis chapel was transformed by bishop 
bronscombe  the vaulting has been recoloured in conformity 
with the ancient tints and patterns the chapel contained several 
monuments but these have been removed to other parts of the cathedral 
bronscombe transformed the chapel that it might be used for his burial 
place st gabriel was his patron saint and he caused the day of the 
archangel to be celebrated with honours similar to easter day and 
christmas day there is some old glass in the windows note the kneeling 
figure of the bishop with the scroll  sancte gabriel archangele 
intercede pro gratia the skilful restoration of the south window with 
pieces of old glass is one of the most happy results of later work in 
the cathedral the altar slab marked with five crosses appears to have 
been used in leofrics monument where it was found in the last century 
it was placed here by dean cowie 

st mary magdalen chapel first mentioned in the fabric rolls for 
 it was probably marshalls work originally bronscombe further 
improved it and quivil entirely remodelled it with the exception of 
the perpendicular screen shutting it off from the north aisle it is of 
the same date as the lady chapel the north window is bronscombes work 
and the still finer east window containing a good deal of the early 
fifteenthcentury glass is quivils the chapel originally contained an 
altar to st john the evangelist and a figure of the magdalene for in 
bishop lacys register are the words extra vestibulum coram ymagine 
sanctae marie magdalene on the floor of the chapel is a brass to canon 
langton dated  he was a cousin of bishop stafford he is 
represented kneeling clothed in a most rich cope and alb on which is 
designed the stafford knot his hands are met in prayer the epitaph 
only gives the date of his death and refers to his relationship with 
the abovenamed bishop 

in this chapel also is a magnificent monument to sir gawain carew and 
his wife and their nephew sir peter it is in two parts on the upper 
lie the figures of sir gawain and his dame on the lower that of the 
more famous nephew with his legs crossed an unusual position for a 
figure on so late a tomb sir peter and his uncle took an active part in 
quashing the rebellion that disturbed the western counties in the reign 
of edward  the former died at waterford in ireland  sir peter 
carew sat on the kings commission of  which summoned the dean and 
chapter to the bishops palace then and there to answer all demands 
and questions concerning the jewells plate and other ornaments of your 
cathedrall churche 

in  the monument was admirably restored by the members of the carew 
family the whole being gilded and coloured 


       

the first tomb to notice on the north side of the choir is that of the 
murdered bishop stapledon the canopy was judiciously restored at the 
beginning of the century from beneath it one observes a great image of 
christ the pierced hands raised to bless the wounded feet stand upon a 
sphere possibly to represent his dominion over the world and an 
insignificant earthly king in scarlet robes seems to take refuge in 
the shadow of the saviour beneath the canopy lies the figure of the 
bishop grasping the crozier in his left hand and a book in his right 
the keys upon his sleeve represent the arms of the see above the 
monument the arms of the bishop figure on the choir screen and over the 
tombs of lacy and marshall the same plan has been observed this screen 
was erected about the close of the fourteenth century 

below the sacrarium on the north are the tombs of the elizabethan 
bishop william bradbridge and that of bishop lacy  his arms 
three shovellers heads erased may be seen on the screen work above 
it the tomb is despoiled of the brass that once adorned itsaid to 
have been taken out by the reformation dean simon hayes who also 
despoiled st radegundes chapel because pilgrims resorted to lacys 
tomb and regarded him as a saint 

the next tomb that of marshall is of peculiar interest and it is 
unfortunate that a good view is not easily attainable it has been 
pointed out by a specialist that the ornament on the chasuble is almost 
unique reminding one of the foliage in early english work the 
medallions at the side are especially interesting 

at the west near the speke chantry is the remarkable monument 
generally supposed to be the tomb of sir richard de stapledon an elder 
brother of the great bishop whose tragic death we have already described 
in the first chapter of this book he was a lawyer and one of his 
majestys judges princes quaint description of his tomb is worth 
quoting in full in a niche in the wall is a monument erected to his 
memory representing his figure lively cut in stone sitting on 
horseback where is cut out also in the same a cripple taking hold of 
the foreleg of his horse which seems to confirm the tradition that a 
certain cripple as sir richard was riding into the city of london with 
his brother lying at the gate laid hold on one of his horses 
forelegs and by crossing of it threw horse and rider to the ground by 
which means he was soon slain and that from this occasion the place 
obtaind the name of cripplegate which it retains to this day it is 
a pity so quaint a story belongs to the realm of legend for there is no 
substantial proof forthcoming of its truth 

illustration     

the next monument on this side is an emaciated figure or memento 
mori a gruesome style popular in the fifteenth century it may have 
been intended for a cenotaph of bishop bothe the legend nearly erased 
at the top being the same as that on his brass in the church of east 
horsley surrey where he is buried 

illustration     
    

the monument to anthony harvey of colomb john is of no great interest 
being poorly designed its date is  harvey was steward of the 
abbeys of hartland buckland and newenham at the time when the 
religious houses were suppressed he is said to have amassed very 
considerable wealth for in addition to the profits derived from the 
spoliation of the above monasteries he received from henry  
considerable lands belonging to the abbey of tewkesbury which he sold 
probably most advantageously to a clothier of crediton harvey was 
connected with the carews through the marriage of his daughter and 
heiress with george carew dean of exeter the notorious pluralist 
their son harveys grandson was created earl of totnes but died 
without issue 

at the west end of the south aisle is the monument of bishop gary 
 and a mural tablet commemorating robert hall eldest son of 
bishop hall and treasurer of the cathedral to him exeter owes a 
perpetual debt of gratitude for when the city surrendered to fairfax 
in  he took down the bishops throne and concealed it buried it 
according to local tradition and after the restoration was able to 
reerect in its proper place the most magnificent bishops throne in 
england 

neither the effigy of bishop cotton  nor the angel resting on the 
sarcophagus of bishop westona typical georgian monumentare of much 
intrinsic merit flaxmans statue to general simcox the hero of the 
queens rangers in the american war is the only other notable 
monumental achievement in the south choir aisle 

the peter or great bell of exeter is said to have been a gift of 
bishop courtenays this opinion is very much disputed as the fabric 
rolls show that there were bells here in the time of edward  as early 
as  is an entry of  for mending the peter bell again in  
twentyfive years before courtenay was created bishop mention is made 
of the spending of twenty pence in una bauderick pro maxima campana in 
campanili boreali oliver however acutely points out that this last 
entry is dated the very year that courtenay was appointed archdeacon of 
exeter and suggests that on that occasion he may have offered such 
valuable presents on the  november  the bell was crazed but 
was recast in  its reputed weight is  lb if this is correct 
it is the second largest bell in england great tom of christ church 
oxford is more than  lb heavier but it easily exceeds its other 
rivals tom of lincoln and the great bell of st pauls which weigh 
respectively  lb and  lb 

     

the chapter house lies at the south end of the transept beyond the 
chapel of the holy ghost the lower part of the room is the original 
building of the early thirteenth century between  and  and the 
face of the wall is decorated with early english arcades separated by 
delicate shafts this building probably had a stone vaulted roof lacy 
heightened it adding lofty perpendicular windows and the whole is 
completed by a rich tiebeam roof partly the work of bishop bothe 
 whose arms with lacys are painted on it see p  the 
east window recently restored contains many coats of arms in ancient 
glass among these is the austrian eagle quartered with the lion of 
bohemia reminding us that richard earl of cornwall brother of henry 
 and lord of rougemont castle exeter was about  elected king 
of the romans thus associating exeter with the highest secular honour 
then known to europe 

the cloisterarchdeacon freeman thinks that originally the cloister 
was confined to the east side as a necessary communication between the 
chapter house and the great south door of the nave during stapledons 
time a desire had been evinced to enlarge this cloister and in  
there is a record to the effect that eight heads had been carved for 
vaulting the cloister in the fabric rolls are entries that show the 
work of building proceeded with some activity and considerable 
cheapness here are a few extracts that are interesting 

twentyfive horseloads of sand for the cloister   thousand lath 
nails and healing pins for do  clifford sculpanti  capites   
do  

by  the work was probably finished to the north and forty years 
later the whole must have been completed it has been said that the old 
cloister was inferior to those of worcester and gloucester but they 
must have had considerable merit if mr pearsons restoration really 
represents and there is little doubt it does the old structure 

it is curious that the cloister certainly the least offensive and not 
the most beautiful part of the cathedral should have suffered so 
severely at the hands of the puritans for on the whole the cathedral 
proper escaped with but small damage professor freeman in discussing 
the alleged desecrations suffered by st mary and st peter after the 
entrance of fairfax and his army into the city writes thus the 
account in mercurius rusticus which has given vogue to the common story 
is wholly untrue he further adds some fanatic soldier may indeed 
according to the story have broken off the head of queen elizabeth 
mistaking her for our lady but no general mutilation or desecration 
took place at this time and at exeter one form of mutilation which 
specially affected the west front was not the work of enemies but of 
devotees for ages the country folk who came into the city loved to 
carry home a peter stone for the healing of their ailments it is only 
fair to add that archdeacon freeman refers in very different language to 
the result of the occupation by the puritans but though the decorative 
portions of the cloister may have suffered we cannot account for the 
disappearance of the exterior walls without a better reason for their 
destruction it should be noted however that in the fifteenth century 
the dean and chapter bitterly complained of the conduct of the exeter 
boys who played unlawfull games as the toppe queke penny pryke  
most atte tenys in the cloister whereby they were defowled  the glas 
windows all tobrost but at this time the cathedral and municipal 
authorities were far from friendly to each other dr oliver writes of 
the ruins in his day that they have disappeared with the exception of 
part of a fluted column at the west corner of the carpenters shop 
with the debris small and mean houses were built on the  of 
october  we are given a hint as to what may have been the meaning 
of this wanton destruction apparently the ground set apart for the 
convenience of the studious and contemplative was found to have 
valuable attributes as a marketplace for on the above day the friday 
cloth market for serges and other drapery was ordered to be held in 
this place commerce did not triumph for long though as only three 
years later the buyers and sellers were bundled back into south street 

illustration        

 large number of bosses and carvings of the original structure 
discovered during the recent excavations have been skilfully 
incorporated by mr pearson in his restoration above the cloister is a 
library containing  volumes many of them bequeathed by the late 
chancellor harrington 

the closethis was an important adjunct to all cathedrals in the 
days following the conquest we have seen that on one occasion at least 
the cathedral church of exeter was severely bombarded with the result 
that the northern tower differs considerably from the southern in 
places the church then we may presume was intended to be used when 
necessary as a fortress but as it was also something else very 
different this necessity was rather shunned than courted therefore it 
was customary to separate the church from the world by walls and gates 
of proved strength this space so secured formed an outer fortress 
against which the attacks of an enemy must perforce have been directed 
first it placed entirely in the hands of the clergy the defence of 
their own church a task they were quite capable of performing with 
credit for matthew paris tells us of one bishop of exeter bruere that 
he displayed activity both spiritual and temporal in the holy land 
the defence of the city that of the sacred building being thus provided 
for was the business of the captains and menatarms the walls and 
gates of the close have vanished without leaving a trace of their 
existence one privilege however yet haunts the placethe corporation 
have no jurisdiction over it 

in the close at the north side of the cathedral has been placed a statue 
of richard hooker the theologian  author of the laws of 
ecclesiastical polity the judicious hooker was born in exeter and 
was a nephew of john vowel alias hoker chamberlain and historian of 
the city 

the cathedral library was founded by leofric himself one of his 
principal reasons for translating the see from crediton to exeter being 
his fear lest the valuable books he had collected should at any time be 
destroyed by raiders in an unfortified town 

when in the beginning of the seventeenth century sir thomas bodley 
himself a native of exeter founded the bodleian library at oxford the 
dean and chapter of exeter presented to it a large number of books and 
manuscripts many of which had belonged to leofric fortunately one 
volume remained in exeter overlooked by owners then unaware of its 
value possibly of its very existence this volume the exeter book 
is the greatest treasure possessed by the dean and chapter being an 
anglosaxon manuscript containing almost a third of all the anglosaxon 
literature that is known the contents include cynewulfs christus a 
poem on the life of our lord some legends of saints and a quaint 
collection of riddles and jokes the ink of its writing nearly one 
thousand years old is as fresh as if it had been inscribed but 
recently 

as already mentioned the muniments room was formerly above st andrews 
chapel at a later date the library was placed in the lady chapel and 
was thence removed to the chapter house towards the end of the last 
century canon cook and chancellor harrington left their valuable 
libraries to the dean and chapter and in order to accommodate the books 
dean cowie restored the south side of the cloister and built a new 
library over it 

here may be seen the exeter book the exeter domesday grandissons 
ordinale lacys pontifical and other beautiful examples of 
illumination also the original charter of edward the confessor 
appointing leofric bishop of exeter signed by the king and queen earl 
godwin and a notable group of saxon thanes 

among the printed books are a first folio of shakespeare and the sealed 
prayer book of king charles  

the library is open to the public after matins on tuesdays and fridays 

the palace is a building so closely associated with the cathedral as 
to demand a brief notice in it is the chapel of st mary which seems 
to have been frequently used in preference to the cathedral for the 
celebration of espiscopal functions ordination services were often held 
within its walls it was originally built that services might be said 
there for the repose of the souls of dead bishops of exeter  document 
is quoted by oliver in which the parish of alwyngton is called upon to 
pay the officiating chaplain a yearly sum of four marks and that of 
harberton two this chapel now restored is used for domestic purposes 
but at one time it was clearly regarded as pertaining to the cathedral 
for the dean and chapter on the festival of st faith presented to it 
a pair of wax candles brantyngham in  mentions the fructus et 
proventus cantariae infra palatium nostrum exonie pro animabus 
predecessorum nostorum ipsius fundatorum the old entrance was under 
the great archway and battlements by gracious permission of royalty 
surrounded the whole in the great hall feasts were held for  poor 
people but the palace now is shorn of a good deal of its grandeur the 
ecclesiastical commissioners in  decided to rebuild and repair what 
remained

was a canon of york when pope boniface  advanced him to the see of 
exeter for a time he served the king as lord high chancellor he has

it is related that when gytha fled towards the river and william the 
conqueror marched through the eastern gate of the city claiming it as 
his prize he promised the citizens their lives goods and limbs but 
although he adhered strictly to his promise and took care that his 
victorious soldiers should not pillage or insult the inhabitants he was 
well aware of the supreme value of his conquest the taking of exeter 
was practically the taking of all western england so he determined to 
make his position impregnable and to this end set about the building of 
a castle on the red mount the task was not a hard one the norman 
engineers had little need to display their peculiar ingenuity nature 
had done much and to her work briton roman and englishman had made 
additions as professor freeman puts it the hillside was ready 
scarped the ditch was ready dug baldwin de molles was appointed 
superintendent and commander and so well did he carry out his trust 
that within a year the castle was built and the men of cornwall and 
devon had attacked its walls in vain perhaps because william had been a 
merciful conqueror not despoiling or illusing the citizens perhaps 
because the citizens were afraid knowing the just man was strong and 
his hand heavy in anger the besiegers found no help within the city 
walls henceforth exeter was for the king 

 curious example of its loyalty was shown in the troubled days of king 
stephen earl baldwin from all accounts a cruel and violent man took 
arms against the king stephen demanded that the castle should be 
delivered up for his answer the earl laid in provisions and at the 
head of his followers patrolled the streets of the city threatening 
vengeance on those who opposed his will stephen speedily apprised by 
his faithful citizens of these riotous doings sent two hundred knights 
to confront the rebel later he came himself and the castle was closely 
besieged after three months heavy fighting the wells in the castle 
gave out deprived of water baldwin who was brave enough made shift 
with wine using it both for cookery and extinguishing the fires but at 
last the king was victorious and not heeding the wise counsel of his 
brother henry of winchester permitted the followers of baldwin to go 
forth with their goods and follow what lord they would 

in  richard  fearing that the west favoured the claims of 
henry earl of richmond hastened to exeter he was civilly greeted by 
john attwill the mayor but his coming was not very welcome nor did 
his conduct contribute to the gaiety of the inhabitants in his train 
was lord scrope whose business it was to try the rebels none could be 
found however save the kings brotherinlaw st leger and his 
esquire john rame richard none the less determined to strike terror 
into the hearts of all who wavered in their allegiance so both men were 
beheaded at the carfax this done the king busied himself in studying 
the surrounding country and made careful note of the city and castle 
the military strength of rougemont pleased him though the name did not 
 west country accent some say gave it a sound like ridgemount too 
close an echo of his rivals title the incident is referred to by 
shakespeare in these wellknown lines 

richmond when  last was at exeter 
the mayor in courtesy showed me the castle 
and called it rougemontat which name  started 
because a bard of ireland told me once 
 should not live long after  saw richmond 

the castle was considerably injured a few years later when perkin 
warbeck at the head of his cornishmen attacked the city the fight 
seems to have been a long and furious one the north gate was burned 
and both there and at the east gate the rebels were temporarily 
successful but after the earl of devon and his retinue came to the help 
of the citizens the rebels were expelled and had to make their way to 
taunton unsuccessful henry soon afterwards arrived bringing perkin 
warbeck with him by his clemency towards the rebels he created real 
enthusiasm so that the prisoners hurled away their halters and cried 
god save the king 

by the time charles  came to the throne the castle was already showing 
gaping chinks and an aged countenance fairfax and his roundheads 
completed the ruin but it was not war only which left the building as 
we now see it an ivycovered gateway is all that remains yet from its 
summit one has a fine view of the surrounding country and can readily 
understand of what strategical value its possession must have been in 
battles long ago

the hand of the reformer proved stronger than that of the victorious 
captain what war had failed to do enterprising citizens accomplished in 
times of peace about the year  the city fathers seem to have been 
animated by an unholy passion for destruction not only was the house of 
the earls of bedford a house full of historic and majestic memories 
pulled down but the venerable fortress attracted attention first a 
gateway then the chapel later the castellans house disappeared new 
assize courts superlatively ugly proudly rose in their stead but even 
then the zeal of the reformers was not satiated ten years later the 
eastern gate with its two mighty flanking towers soaring over the 
picturesque house on each side with its wide and lofty tudor arch 
spanning the road its statue of henry the seventh commemorating its 
rebuilding after the siege by perkin warbeckthe gate which was heir to 
that through which the conqueror made his wayall perished to the 
great satisfaction of the exeter of that day for a beautiful vista was 
opened from st sidwells into the high street a very great and 
necessary improvement it is easy to share professor freemans 
indignation less easy unhappily to persuade men of our own day to 
deal kindly by the ancient monuments that are still left to us 

another building that has played a notable part in the history of the 
city is the guildhall of which the portico makes so pleasing an 
ornament to the high street the building is a picturesque medley 
english windows and italian pillars and professor freeman wittily 
suggests that it serves to remind us of the jumble of tongues 
characterizing much of the law business that has been done within it 
the present building was built in  replacing one of earlier date 
there are many pictures of local interest in the hall and also 
portraits by sir peter lely of princess henrietta anne duchess of 
orleans and of general monk the princess was born in exeter and the 
portrait was presented to the city by charles  after the restoration 
general monk belonged to a devonshire family whose residence was near 
torrington there seems to have been at one time a guild or 
confraternity connected with the chapel of st george erected over the 
hall about the last year of richard  in the accounts are found 
entries such as this principae and others for exequis and masses said 
in the chapel of guildhall for the repose of the souls for the brothers 
and sisters of the fraternity of st george 

when richard  was nearing the end of his reign the roof was 
fortified by a gun placed in charge of john croker and ten soldiers it 
is a strange coincidence that the chapel should have been built at this 
time evidently the wise citizens were determined to protect their 
interests both here and hereafter

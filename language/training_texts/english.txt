marley was dead to begin with there is no doubt whatever about that 
the register of his burial was signed by the clergyman the clerk the 
undertaker and the chief mourner scrooge signed it and scrooges name 
was good upon change for anything he chose to put his hand to old 
marley was as dead as a doornail 

mind  dont mean to say that  know of my own knowledge what there is 
particularly dead about a doornail  might have been inclined myself 
to regard a coffinnail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the 
trade but the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile and my 
unhallowed hands shall not disturb it or the countrys done for you 
will therefore permit me to repeat emphatically that marley was as 
dead as a doornail 

scrooge knew he was dead of course he did how could it be otherwise 
scrooge and he were partners for  dont know how many years scrooge 
was his sole executor his sole administrator his sole assign his sole 
residuary legatee his sole friend and sole mourner and even scrooge 
was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an 
excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral and solemnised 
it with an undoubted bargain 

the mention of marleys funeral brings me back to the point  started 
from there is no doubt that marley was dead this must be distinctly 
understood or nothing wonderful can come of the story  am going to 
relate if we were not perfectly convinced that hamlets father died 
before the play began there would be nothing more remarkable in his 
taking a stroll at night in an easterly wind upon his own ramparts 
than there would be in any other middleaged gentleman rashly turning 
out after dark in a breezy spotsay st pauls churchyard for 
instanceliterally to astonish his sons weak mind 

scrooge never painted out old marleys name there it stood years 
afterwards above the warehouse door scrooge and marley the firm was 
known as scrooge and marley sometimes people new to the business called 
scrooge scrooge and sometimes marley but he answered to both names it 
was all the same to him 

oh but he was a tightfisted hand at the grindstone scrooge a 
squeezing wrenching grasping scraping clutching covetous old 
sinner hard and sharp as flint from which no steel had ever struck out 
generous fire secret and selfcontained and solitary as an oyster 
the cold within him froze his old features nipped his pointed nose 
shrivelled his cheek stiffened his gait made his eyes red his thin 
lips blue and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice  frosty rime 
was on his head and on his eyebrows and his wiry chin he carried his 
own low temperature always about with him he iced his office in the 
dogdays and didnt thaw it one degree at christmas 

external heat and cold had little influence on scrooge no warmth could 
warm no wintry weather chill him no wind that blew was bitterer than 
he no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose no pelting rain 
less open to entreaty foul weather didnt know where to have him the 
heaviest rain and snow and hail and sleet could boast of the 
advantage over him in only one respect they often came down 
handsomely and scrooge never did 

nobody ever stopped him in the street to say with gladsome looks my 
dear scrooge how are you when will you come to see me no beggars 
implored him to bestow a trifle no children asked him what it was 
oclock no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to 
such and such a place of scrooge even the blind mens dogs appeared to 
know him and when they saw him coming on would tug their owners into 
doorways and up courts and then would wag their tails as though they 
said no eye at all is better than an evil eye dark master 

but what did scrooge care it was the very thing he liked to edge his 
way along the crowded paths of life warning all human sympathy to keep 
its distance was what the knowing ones call nuts to scrooge 

once upon a timeof all the good days in the year on christmas 
eveold scrooge sat busy in his countinghouse it was cold bleak 
biting weather foggy withal and he could hear the people in the court 
outside go wheezing up and down beating their hands upon their breasts 
and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them the city 
clocks had only just gone three but it was quite dark alreadyit had 
not been light all dayand candles were flaring in the windows of the 
neighbouring offices like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air the 
fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole and was so dense 
without that although the court was of the narrowest the houses 
opposite were mere phantoms to see the dingy cloud come drooping down 
obscuring everything one might have thought that nature lived hard by 
and was brewing on a large scale 

the door of scrooges countinghouse was open that he might keep his 
eye upon his clerk who in a dismal little cell beyond a sort of tank 
was copying letters scrooge had a very small fire but the clerks fire 
was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal but he couldnt 
replenish it for scrooge kept the coalbox in his own room and so 
surely as the clerk came in with the shovel the master predicted that 
it would be necessary for them to part wherefore the clerk put on his 
white comforter and tried to warm himself at the candle in which 
effort not being a man of strong imagination he failed 

 merry christmas uncle god save you cried a cheerful voice it was 
the voice of scrooges nephew who came upon him so quickly that this 
was the first intimation he had of his approach 

bah said scrooge humbug 

he had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost this 
nephew of scrooges that he was all in a glow his face was ruddy and 
handsome his eyes sparkled and his breath smoked again 

christmas a humbug uncle said scrooges nephew you dont mean 
that  am sure 

 do said scrooge merry christmas what right have you to be merry 
what reason have you to be merry youre poor enough 

come then returned the nephew gaily what right have you to be 
dismal what reason have you to be morose youre rich enough 

scrooge having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment said 
bah again and followed it up with humbug 

dont be cross uncle said the nephew 

what else can  be returned the uncle when  live in such a world 
of fools as this merry christmas out upon merry christmas whats 
christmastime to you but a time for paying bills without money a time 
for finding yourself a year older and not an hour richer a time for 
balancing your books and having every item in em through a round dozen 
of months presented dead against you if  could work my will said 
scrooge indignantly every idiot who goes about with merry christmas 
on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a 
stake of holly through his heart he should 

uncle pleaded the nephew 

nephew returned the uncle sternly keep christmas in your own way 
and let me keep it in mine 

keep it repeated scrooges nephew but you dont keep it 

let me leave it alone then said scrooge much good may it do you 
much good it has ever done you 

there are many things from which  might have derived good by which  
have not profited  dare say returned the nephew christmas among 
the rest but  am sure  have always thought of christmastime when 
it has come roundapart from the veneration due to its sacred name and 
origin if anything belonging to it can be apart from thatas a good 
time a kind forgiving charitable pleasant time the only time  know 
of in the long calendar of the year when men and women seem by one 
consent to open their shutup hearts freely and to think of people 
below them as if they really were fellowpassengers to the grave and 
not another race of creatures bound on other journeys and therefore 
uncle though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket  
believe that it has done me good and will do me good and  say god 
bless it 

the clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded becoming immediately 
sensible of the impropriety he poked the fire and extinguished the 
last frail spark for ever 

let me hear another sound from you said scrooge and youll keep 
your christmas by losing your situation youre quite a powerful 
speaker sir he added turning to his nephew  wonder you dont go 
into parliament 

dont be angry uncle come dine with us tomorrow 

scrooge said that he would see himyes indeed he did he went the 
whole length of the expression and said that he would see him in that 
extremity first 

but why cried scrooges nephew why 

why did you get married said scrooge 

because  fell in love 

because you fell in love growled scrooge as if that were the only 
one thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry christmas good 
afternoon 

nay uncle but you never came to see me before that happened why give 
it as a reason for not coming now 

good afternoon said scrooge 

 want nothing from you  ask nothing of you why cannot we be 
friends 

good afternoon said scrooge 

 am sorry with all my heart to find you so resolute we have never 
had any quarrel to which  have been a party but  have made the trial 
in homage to christmas and ill keep my christmas humour to the last 
so  merry christmas uncle 

good afternoon said scrooge 

and  happy new year 

good afternoon said scrooge 

his nephew left the room without an angry word notwithstanding he 
stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the 
clerk who cold as he was was warmer than scrooge for he returned 
them cordially 

theres another fellow muttered scrooge who overheard him my 
clerk with fifteen shillings a week and a wife and family talking 
about a merry christmas ill retire to bedlam 

this lunatic in letting scrooges nephew out had let two other people 
in they were portly gentlemen pleasant to behold and now stood with 
their hats off in scrooges office they had books and papers in their 
hands and bowed to him 

scrooge and marleys  believe said one of the gentlemen referring 
to his list have  the pleasure of addressing mr scrooge or mr 
marley 

mr marley has been dead these seven years scrooge replied he died 
seven years ago this very night 

we have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving 
partner said the gentleman presenting his credentials 

illustration        

it certainly was for they had been two kindred spirits at the ominous 
word liberality scrooge frowned and shook his head and handed the 
credentials back 

at this festive season of the year mr scrooge said the gentleman 
taking up a pen it is more than usually desirable that we should make 
some slight provision for the poor and destitute who suffer greatly at 
the present time many thousands are in want of common necessaries 
hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts sir 

are there no prisons asked scrooge 

plenty of prisons said the gentleman laying down the pen again 

and the union workhouses demanded scrooge are they still in 
operation 

they are still returned the gentleman  wish  could say they were 
not 

the treadmill and the poor law are in full vigour then said scrooge 

both very busy sir 

oh  was afraid from what you said at first that something had 
occurred to stop them in their useful course said scrooge  am very 
glad to hear it 

under the impression that they scarcely furnish christian cheer of mind 
or body to the multitude returned the gentleman a few of us are 
endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink and 
means of warmth we choose this time because it is a time of all 
others when want is keenly felt and abundance rejoices what shall  
put you down for 

nothing scrooge replied 

you wish to be anonymous 

 wish to be left alone said scrooge since you ask me what  wish 
gentlemen that is my answer  dont make merry myself at christmas 
and  cant afford to make idle people merry  help to support the 
establishments  have mentionedthey cost enough and those who are 
badly off must go there 

many cant go there and many would rather die 

if they would rather die said scrooge they had better do it and 
decrease the surplus population besidesexcuse mei dont know that 

but you might know it observed the gentleman 

its not my business scrooge returned its enough for a man to 
understand his own business and not to interfere with other peoples 
mine occupies me constantly good afternoon gentlemen 

seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point the 
gentlemen withdrew scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion 
of himself and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him 

meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so that people ran about with 
flaring links proffering their services to go before horses in 
carriages and conduct them on their way the ancient tower of a church 
whose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at scrooge out of a 
gothic window in the wall became invisible and struck the hours and 
quarters in the clouds with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if its 
teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there the cold became 
intense in the main street at the corner of the court some labourers 
were repairing the gaspipes and had lighted a great fire in a brazier 
round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered warming their 
hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture the waterplug 
being left in solitude its overflowings suddenly congealed and turned 
to misanthropic ice the brightness of the shops where holly sprigs and 
berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows made pale faces ruddy 
as they passed poulterers and grocers trades became a splendid joke 
a glorious pageant with which it was next to impossible to believe that 
such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do the lord 
mayor in the stronghold of the mighty mansion house gave orders to his 
fifty cooks and butlers to keep christmas as a lord mayors household 
should and even the little tailor whom he had fined five shillings on 
the previous monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets 
stirred up tomorrows pudding in his garret while his lean wife and 
the baby sallied out to buy the beef 

foggier yet and colder piercing searching biting cold if the good 
st dunstan had but nipped the evil spirits nose with a touch of such 
weather as that instead of using his familiar weapons then indeed he 
would have roared to lusty purpose the owner of one scant young nose 
gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs 
stooped down at scrooges keyhole to regale him with a christmas carol 
but at the first sound of 

god bless you merry gentleman 
may nothing you dismay 

scrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled 
in terror leaving the keyhole to the fog and even more congenial 
frost 

at length the hour of shutting up the countinghouse arrived with an 
illwill scrooge dismounted from his stool and tacitly admitted the 
fact to the expectant clerk in the tank who instantly snuffed his 
candle out and put on his hat 

youll want all day tomorrow  suppose said scrooge 

if quite convenient sir 

its not convenient said scrooge and its not fair if  was to 
stop halfacrown for it youd think yourself ill used ill be bound 

the clerk smiled faintly 

and yet said scrooge you dont think me ill used when  pay a 
days wages for no work 

illustration bob cratchit went down a slide on cornhill at the end 
of a lane of boys twenty times in honour of its being christmas 
eve 

the clerk observed that it was only once a year 

 poor excuse for picking a mans pocket every twentyfifth of 
december said scrooge buttoning his greatcoat to the chin but  
suppose you must have the whole day be here all the earlier next 
morning 

the clerk promised that he would and scrooge walked out with a growl 
the office was closed in a twinkling and the clerk with the long ends 
of his white comforter dangling below his waist for he boasted no 
greatcoat went down a slide on cornhill at the end of a lane of boys 
twenty times in honour of its being christmas eve and then ran home to 
camden town as hard as he could pelt to play at blind mansbuff 

scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern and 
having read all the newspapers and beguiled the rest of the evening 
with his bankers book went home to bed he lived in chambers which had 
once belonged to his deceased partner they were a gloomy suite of 
rooms in a lowering pile of building up a yard where it had so little 
business to be that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run 
there when it was a young house playing at hideandseek with other 
houses and have forgotten the way out again it was old enough now and 
dreary enough for nobody lived in it but scrooge the other rooms 
being all let out as offices the yard was so dark that even scrooge 
who knew its every stone was fain to grope with his hands the fog and 
frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house that it seemed 
as if the genius of the weather sat in mournful meditation on the 
threshold 

now it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the 
knocker on the door except that it was very large it is also a fact 
that scrooge had seen it night and morning during his whole residence 
in that place also that scrooge had as little of what is called fancy 
about him as any man in the city of london even includingwhich is a 
bold wordthe corporation aldermen and livery let it also be borne 
in mind that scrooge had not bestowed one thought on marley since his 
last mention of his sevenyearsdead partner that afternoon and then 
let any man explain to me if he can how it happened that scrooge 
having his key in the lock of the door saw in the knocker without its 
undergoing any intermediate process of changenot a knocker but 
marleys face 

marleys face it was not in impenetrable shadow as the other objects 
in the yard were but had a dismal light about it like a bad lobster in 
a dark cellar it was not angry or ferocious but looked at scrooge as 
marley used to look with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly 
forehead the hair was curiously stirred as if by breath or hot air 
and though the eyes were wide open they were perfectly motionless 
that and its livid colour made it horrible but its horror seemed to 
be in spite of the face and beyond its control rather than a part of 
its own expression 

as scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon it was a knocker again 

to say that he was not startled or that his blood was not conscious of 
a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy would 
be untrue but he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished turned 
it sturdily walked in and lighted his candle 

he did pause with a moments irresolution before he shut the door 
and he did look cautiously behind it first as if he half expected to 
be terrified with the sight of marleys pigtail sticking out into the 
hall but there was nothing on the back of the door except the screws 
and nuts that held the knocker on so he said pooh pooh and closed 
it with a bang 

the sound resounded through the house like thunder every room above 
and every cask in the winemerchants cellars below appeared to have a 
separate peal of echoes of its own scrooge was not a man to be 
frightened by echoes he fastened the door and walked across the hall 
and up the stairs slowly too trimming his candle as he went 

you may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight 
of stairs or through a bad young act of parliament but  mean to say 
you might have got a hearse up that staircase and taken it broadwise 
with the splinterbar towards the wall and the door towards the 
balustrades and done it easy there was plenty of width for that and 
room to spare which is perhaps the reason why scrooge thought he saw a 
locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom halfadozen 
gaslamps out of the street wouldnt have lighted the entry too well so 
you may suppose that it was pretty dark with scrooges dip 

up scrooge went not caring a button for that darkness is cheap and 
scrooge liked it but before he shut his heavy door he walked through 
his rooms to see that all was right he had just enough recollection of 
the face to desire to do that 

sittingroom bedroom lumberroom all as they should be nobody under 
the table nobody under the sofa a small fire in the grate spoon and 
basin ready and the little saucepan of gruel scrooge had a cold in his 
head upon the hob nobody under the bed nobody in the closet nobody 
in his dressinggown which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude 
against the wall lumberroom as usual old fireguard old shoes two 
fish baskets washingstand on three legs and a poker 

illustration nobody under the bed nobody in the closet nobody in 
his dressinggown which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against 
the wall 

quite satisfied he closed his door and locked himself in double 
locked himself in which was not his custom thus secured against 
surprise he took off his cravat put on his dressinggown and slippers 
and his nightcap and sat down before the fire to take his gruel 

it was a very low fire indeed nothing on such a bitter night he was 
obliged to sit close to it and brood over it before he could extract 
the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel the fireplace 
was an old one built by some dutch merchant long ago and paved all 
round with quaint dutch tiles designed to illustrate the scriptures 
there were cains and abels pharaohs daughters queens of sheba 
angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like 
featherbeds abrahams belshazzars apostles putting off to sea in 
butterboats hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts and yet that 
face of marley seven years dead came like the ancient prophets rod 
and swallowed up the whole if each smooth tile had been a blank at 
first with power to shape some picture on its surface from the 
disjointed fragments of his thoughts there would have been a copy of 
old marleys head on every one 

humbug said scrooge and walked across the room 

after several turns he sat down again as he threw his head back in the 
chair his glance happened to rest upon a bell a disused bell that 
hung in the room and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with 
a chamber in the highest storey of the building it was with great 
astonishment and with a strange inexplicable dread that as he 
looked he saw this bell begin to swing it swung so softly in the 
outset that it scarcely made a sound but soon it rang out loudly and 
so did every bell in the house 

this might have lasted half a minute or a minute but it seemed an 
hour the bells ceased as they had begun together they were succeeded 
by a clanking noise deep down below as if some person were dragging a 
heavy chain over the casks in the winemerchants cellar scrooge then 
remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as 
dragging chains 

the cellar door flew open with a booming sound and then he heard the 
noise much louder on the floors below then coming up the stairs then 
coming straight towards his door 

its humbug still said scrooge  wont believe it 

his colour changed though when without a pause it came on through 
the heavy door and passed into the room before his eyes upon its coming 
in the dying flame leaped up as though it cried  know him marleys 
ghost and fell again 

the same face the very same marley in his pigtail usual waistcoat 
tights and boots the tassels on the latter bristling like his 
pigtail and his coatskirts and the hair upon his head the chain he 
drew was clasped about his middle it was long and wound about him like 
a tail and it was made for scrooge observed it closely of cashboxes 
keys padlocks ledgers deeds and heavy purses wrought in steel his 
body was transparent so that scrooge observing him and looking 
through his waistcoat could see the two buttons on his coat behind 

scrooge had often heard it said that marley had no bowels but he had 
never believed it until now 

no nor did he believe it even now though he looked the phantom through 
and through and saw it standing before him though he felt the chilling 
influence of its deathcold eyes and marked the very texture of the 
folded kerchief bound about its head and chin which wrapper he had not 
observed before he was still incredulous and fought against his 
senses 

how now said scrooge caustic and cold as ever what do you want 
with me 

muchmarleys voice no doubt about it 

who are you 

ask me who  was 

who were you then said scrooge raising his voice youre 
particular for a shade he was going to say to a shade but 
substituted this as more appropriate 

in life  was your partner jacob marley 

can youcan you sit down asked scrooge looking doubtfully at him 

 can 

do it then 

scrooge asked the question because he didnt know whether a ghost so 
transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair and felt 
that in the event of its being impossible it might involve the 
necessity of an embarrassing explanation but the ghost sat down on the 
opposite side of the fireplace as if he were quite used to it 

you dont believe in me observed the ghost 

 dont said scrooge 

what evidence would you have of my reality beyond that of your own 
senses 

 dont know said scrooge 

why do you doubt your senses 

because said scrooge a little thing affects them  slight disorder 
of the stomach makes them cheats you may be an undigested bit of beef 
a blot of mustard a crumb of cheese a fragment of an underdone potato 
theres more of gravy than of grave about you whatever you are 

scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes nor did he feel in 
his heart by any means waggish then the truth is that he tried to be 
smart as a means of distracting his own attention and keeping down his 
terror for the spectres voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones 

to sit staring at those fixed glazed eyes in silence for a moment 
would play scrooge felt the very deuce with him there was something 
very awful too in the spectres being provided with an infernal 
atmosphere of his own scrooge could not feel it himself but this was 
clearly the case for though the ghost sat perfectly motionless its 
hair and skirts and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour 
from an oven 

you see this toothpick said scrooge returning quickly to the charge 
for the reason just assigned and wishing though it were only for a 
second to divert the visions stony gaze from himself 

 do replied the ghost 

you are not looking at it said scrooge 

but  see it said the ghost notwithstanding 

well returned scrooge  have but to swallow this and be for the 
rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins all of my own 
creation humbug  tell you humbug 

at this the spirit raised a frightful cry and shook its chain with such 
a dismal and appalling noise that scrooge held on tight to his chair 
to save himself from falling in a swoon but how much greater was his 
horror when the phantom taking off the bandage round his head as if it 
were too warm to wear indoors its lower jaw dropped down upon its 
breast 

scrooge fell upon his knees and clasped his hands before his face 

mercy he said dreadful apparition why do you trouble me 

man of the worldly mind replied the ghost do you believe in me or 
not 

 do said scrooge  must but why do spirits walk the earth and 
why do they come to me 

it is required of every man the ghost returned that the spirit 
within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen and travel far and 
wide and if that spirit goes not forth in life it is condemned to do 
so after death it is doomed to wander through the worldoh woe is 
meand witness what it cannot share but might have shared on earth 
and turned to happiness 

again the spectre raised a cry and shook its chain and wrung its 
shadowy hands 

you are fettered said scrooge trembling tell me why 

 wear the chain  forged in life replied the ghost  made it link 
by link and yard by yard  girded it on of my own free will and of 
my own free will  wore it is its pattern strange to you 

scrooge trembled more and more 

or would you know pursued the ghost the weight and length of the 
strong coil you bear yourself it was full as heavy and as long as this 
seven christmas eves ago you have laboured on it since it is a 
ponderous chain 

scrooge glanced about him on the floor in the expectation of finding 
himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable but he 
could see nothing 

jacob he said imploringly old jacob marley tell me more speak 
comfort to me jacob 

 have none to give the ghost replied it comes from other regions 
ebenezer scrooge and is conveyed by other ministers to other kinds of 
men nor can  tell you what  would  very little more is all 
permitted to me  cannot rest  cannot stay  cannot linger anywhere 
my spirit never walked beyond our countinghousemark mein life my 
spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our moneychanging hole 
and weary journeys lie before me 

it was a habit with scrooge whenever he became thoughtful to put his 
hands in his breeches pockets pondering on what the ghost had said he 
did so now but without lifting up his eyes or getting off his knees 

illustration       

you must have been very slow about it jacob scrooge observed in a 
businesslike manner though with humility and deference 

slow the ghost repeated 

seven years dead mused scrooge and travelling all the time 

the whole time said the ghost no rest no peace incessant torture 
of remorse 

you travel fast said scrooge 

illustration 

on the wings of the wind replied the ghost 

you might have got over a great quantity of ground in seven years 
said scrooge 

the ghost on hearing this set up another cry and clanked its chain so 
hideously in the dead silence of the night that the ward would have 
been justified in indicting it for a nuisance 

oh captive bound and doubleironed cried the phantom not to know 
that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures for this earth 
must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is 
all developed not to know that any christian spirit working kindly in 
its little sphere whatever it may be will find its mortal life too 
short for its vast means of usefulness not to know that no space of 
regret can make amends for one lifes opportunities misused yet such 
was  oh such was  

but you were always a good man of business jacob faltered scrooge 
who now began to apply this to himself 

business cried the ghost wringing its hands again mankind was my 
business the common welfare was my business charity mercy 
forbearance and benevolence were all my business the dealings of my 
trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my 
business 

it held up its chain at armslength as if that were the cause of all 
its unavailing grief and flung it heavily upon the ground again 

at this time of the rolling year the spectre said  suffer most 
why did  walk through crowds of fellowbeings with my eyes turned down 
and never raise them to that blessed star which led the wise men to a 
poor abode were there no poor homes to which its light would have 
conducted me 

scrooge was very much dismayed to hear the spectre going on at this 
rate and began to quake exceedingly 

hear me cried the ghost my time is nearly gone 

 will said scrooge but dont be hard upon me dont be flowery 
jacob pray 

how it is that  appear before you in a shape that you can see  may 
not tell  have sat invisible beside you many and many a day 

it was not an agreeable idea scrooge shivered and wiped the 
perspiration from his brow 

that is no light part of my penance pursued the ghost  am here 
tonight to warn you that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my 
fate  chance and hope of my procuring ebenezer 

you were always a good friend to me said scrooge thankee 

you will be haunted resumed the ghost by three spirits 

scrooges countenance fell almost as low as the ghosts had done 

is that the chance and hope you mentioned jacob he demanded in a 
faltering voice 

it is 

 think id rather not said scrooge 

without their visits said the ghost you cannot hope to shun the 
path  tread expect the first tomorrow when the bell tolls one 

couldnt  take em all at once and have it over jacob hinted 
scrooge 

expect the second on the next night at the same hour the third upon 
the next night when the last stroke of twelve has ceased to vibrate 
look to see me no more and look that for your own sake you remember 
what has passed between us 

when it had said these words the spectre took its wrapper from the 
table and bound it round its head as before scrooge knew this by the 
smart sound its teeth made when the jaws were brought together by the 
bandage he ventured to raise his eyes again and found his supernatural 
visitor confronting him in an erect attitude with its chain wound over 
and about its arm 

illustration the air was filled with phantoms wandering hither and 
thither in restless haste and moaning as they went 

the apparition walked backward from him and at every step it took the 
window raised itself a little so that when the spectre reached it it 
was wide open it beckoned scrooge to approach which he did when they 
were within two paces of each other marleys ghost held up its hand 
warning him to come no nearer scrooge stopped 

not so much in obedience as in surprise and fear for on the raising of 
the hand he became sensible of confused noises in the air incoherent 
sounds of lamentation and regret wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and 
selfaccusatory the spectre after listening for a moment joined in 
the mournful dirge and floated out upon the bleak dark night 

scrooge followed to the window desperate in his curiosity he looked 
out 

the air was filled with phantoms wandering hither and thither in 
restless haste and moaning as they went every one of them wore chains 
like marleys ghost some few they might be guilty governments were 
linked together none were free many had been personally known to 
scrooge in their lives he had been quite familiar with one old ghost in 
a white waistcoat with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle who 
cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an 
infant whom it saw below upon a doorstep the misery with them all was 
clearly that they sought to interfere for good in human matters and 
had lost the power for ever 

whether these creatures faded into mist or mist enshrouded them he 
could not tell but they and their spirit voices faded together and 
the night became as it had been when he walked home 

scrooge closed the window and examined the door by which the ghost had 
entered it was double locked as he had locked it with his own hands 
and the bolts were undisturbed he tried to say humbug but stopped at 
the first syllable and being from the emotions he had undergone or 
the fatigues of the day or his glimpse of the invisible world or the 
dull conversation of the ghost or the lateness of the hour much in 
need of repose went straight to bed without undressing and fell asleep 
upon the instant 

illustration

when scrooge awoke it was so dark that looking out of bed he could 
scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his 
chamber he was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret 
eyes when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters 
so he listened for the hour 

to his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven and 
from seven to eight and regularly up to twelve then stopped twelve 
it was past two when he went to bed the clock was wrong an icicle must 
have got into the works twelve 

he touched the spring of his repeater to correct this most preposterous 
clock its rapid little pulse beat twelve and stopped 

why it isnt possible said scrooge that  can have slept through a 
whole day and far into another night it isnt possible that anything 
has happened to the sun and this is twelve at noon 

the idea being an alarming one he scrambled out of bed and groped his 
way to the window he was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve 
of his dressinggown before he could see anything and could see very 
little then all he could make out was that it was still very foggy and 
extremely cold and that there was no noise of people running to and 
fro and making a great stir as there unquestionably would have been if 
night had beaten off bright day and taken possession of the world this 
was a great relief because three days after sight of this first of 
exchange pay to mr ebenezer scrooge or his order and so forth would 
have become a mere united states security if there were no days to count 
by 

scrooge went to bed again and thought and thought and thought it over 
and over and could make nothing of it the more he thought the more 
perplexed he was and the more he endeavoured not to think the more he 
thought 

marleys ghost bothered him exceedingly every time he resolved within 
himself after mature inquiry that it was all a dream his mind flew 
back again like a strong spring released to its first position and 
presented the same problem to be worked all through was it a dream or 
not 

scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone threequarters more 
when he remembered on a sudden that the ghost had warned him of a 
visitation when the bell tolled one he resolved to lie awake until the 
hour was passed and considering that he could no more go to sleep than 
go to heaven this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power 

the quarter was so long that he was more than once convinced he must 
have sunk into a doze unconsciously and missed the clock at length it 
broke upon his listening ear 

ding dong 

 quarter past said scrooge counting 

ding dong 

half past said scrooge 

ding dong 

 quarter to it said scrooge 

ding dong 

the hour itself said scrooge triumphantly and nothing else 

he spoke before the hour bell sounded which it now did with a deep 
dull hollow melancholy  light flashed up in the room upon the 
instant and the curtains of his bed were drawn 

the curtains of his bed were drawn aside  tell you by a hand not 
the curtains at his feet nor the curtains at his back but those to 
which his face was addressed the curtains of his bed were drawn aside 
and scrooge starting up into a halfrecumbent attitude found himself 
face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them as close to it as 
 am now to you and  am standing in the spirit at your elbow 

it was a strange figurelike a child yet not so like a child as like 
an old man viewed through some supernatural medium which gave him the 
appearance of having receded from the view and being diminished to a 
childs proportions its hair which hung about its neck and down its 
back was white as if with age and yet the face had not a wrinkle in 
it and the tenderest bloom was on the skin the arms were very long and 
muscular the hands the same as if its hold were of uncommon strength 
its legs and feet most delicately formed were like those upper 
members bare it wore a tunic of the purest white and round its waist 
was bound a lustrous belt the sheen of which was beautiful it held a 
branch of fresh green holly in its hand and in singular contradiction 
of that wintry emblem had its dress trimmed with summer flowers but 
the strangest thing about it was that from the crown of its head there 
sprang a bright clear jet of light by which all this was visible and 
which was doubtless the occasion of its using in its duller moments a 
great extinguisher for a cap which it now held under its arm 

even this though when scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness 
was not its strangest quality for as its belt sparkled and 
glittered now in one part and now in another and what was light one 
instant at another time was dark so the figure itself fluctuated in its 
distinctness being now a thing with one arm now with one leg now with 
twenty legs now a pair of legs without a head now a head without a 
body of which dissolving parts no outline would be visible in the dense 
gloom wherein they melted away and in the very wonder of this it 
would be itself again distinct and clear as ever 

are you the spirit sir whose coming was foretold to me asked 
scrooge 

 am 

the voice was soft and gentle singularly low as if instead of being 
so close behind him it were at a distance 

who and what are you scrooge demanded 

 am the ghost of christmas past 

long past inquired scrooge observant of its dwarfish stature 

no your past 

perhaps scrooge could not have told anybody why if anybody could have 
asked him but he had a special desire to see the spirit in his cap 
and begged him to be covered 

what exclaimed the ghost would you so soon put out with worldly 
hands the light  give is it not enough that you are one of those 
whose passions made this cap and force me through whole trains of years 
to wear it low upon my brow 

scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge 
of having wilfully bonneted the spirit at any period of his life he 
then made bold to inquire what business brought him there 

your welfare said the ghost 

scrooge expressed himself much obliged but could not help thinking that 
a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end the 
spirit must have heard him thinking for it said immediately 

your reclamation then take heed 

it put out its strong hand as it spoke and clasped him gently by the 
arm 

rise and walk with me 

it would have been in vain for scrooge to plead that the weather and the 
hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes that bed was warm and the 
thermometer a long way below freezing that he was clad but lightly in 
his slippers dressinggown and nightcap and that he had a cold upon 
him at that time the grasp though gentle as a womans hand was not 
to be resisted he rose but finding that the spirit made towards the 
window clasped its robe in supplication 

 am a mortal scrooge remonstrated and liable to fall 

bear but a touch of my hand there said the spirit laying it upon 
his heart and you shall be upheld in more than this 

as the words were spoken they passed through the wall and stood upon 
an open country road with fields on either hand the city had entirely 
vanished not a vestige of it was to be seen the darkness and the mist 
had vanished with it for it was a clear cold winter day with snow 
upon the ground 

good heaven said scrooge clasping his hands together as he looked 
about him  was bred in this place  was a boy here 

the spirit gazed upon him mildly its gentle touch though it had been 
light and instantaneous appeared still present to the old mans sense 
of feeling he was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air 
each one connected with a thousand thoughts and hopes and joys and 
cares long long forgotten 

your lip is trembling said the ghost and what is that upon your 
cheek 

scrooge muttered with an unusual catching in his voice that it was a 
pimple and begged the ghost to lead him where he would 

you recollect the way inquired the spirit 

remember it cried scrooge with fervour  could walk it blindfold 

strange to have forgotten it for so many years observed the ghost 
let us go on 

they walked along the road scrooge recognising every gate and post 
and tree until a little markettown appeared in the distance with its 
bridge its church and winding river some shaggy ponies now were seen 
trotting towards them with boys upon their backs who called to other 
boys in country gigs and carts driven by farmers all these boys were 
in great spirits and shouted to each other until the broad fields were 
so full of merry music that the crisp air laughed to hear it 

these are but shadows of the things that have been said the ghost 
they have no consciousness of us 

the jocund travellers came on and as they came scrooge knew and named 
them every one why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them why 
did his cold eye glisten and his heart leap up as they went past why 
was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other merry 
christmas as they parted at crossroads and byways for their several 
homes what was merry christmas to scrooge out upon merry christmas 
what good had it ever done to him 

the school is not quite deserted said the ghost  solitary child 
neglected by his friends is left there still 

scrooge said he knew it and he sobbed 

they left the highroad by a wellremembered lane and soon approached a 
mansion of dull red brick with a little weathercock surmounted cupola 
on the roof and a bell hanging in it it was a large house but one of 
broken fortunes for the spacious offices were little used their walls 
were damp and mossy their windows broken and their gates decayed 
fowls clucked and strutted in the stables and the coachhouses and 
sheds were overrun with grass nor was it more retentive of its ancient 
state within for entering the dreary hall and glancing through the 
open doors of many rooms they found them poorly furnished cold and 
vast there was an earthy savour in the air a chilly bareness in the 
place which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by 
candle light and not too much to eat 

they went the ghost and scrooge across the hall to a door at the back 
of the house it opened before them and disclosed a long bare 
melancholy room made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and 
desks at one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire and 
scrooge sat down upon a form and wept to see his poor forgotten self as 
he had used to be 

not a latent echo in the house not a squeak and scuffle from the mice 
behind the panelling not a drip from the halfthawed waterspout in the 
dull yard behind not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent 
poplar not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door no not a 
clicking in the fire but fell upon the heart of scrooge with softening 
influence and gave a freer passage to his tears 

the spirit touched him on the arm and pointed to his younger self 
intent upon his reading suddenly a man in foreign garments wonderfully 
real and distinct to look at stood outside the window with an axe 
stuck in his belt and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood 

why its ali baba scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy its dear old 
honest ali baba yes yes  know one christmastime when yonder 
solitary child was left here all alone he did come for the first 
time just like that poor boy and valentine said scrooge and his 
wild brother orson there they go and whats his name who was put 
down in his drawers asleep at the gate of damascus dont you see him 
and the sultans groom turned upside down by the genii there he is upon 
his head serve him right im glad of it what business had he to be 
married to the princess 

to hear scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such 
subjects in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying and 
to see his heightened and excited face would have been a surprise to 
his business friends in the city indeed 

theres the parrot cried scrooge green body and yellow tail with a 
thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head there he is 
poor robin crusoe he called him when he came home again after sailing 
round the island poor robin crusoe where have you been robin 
crusoe the man thought he was dreaming but he wasnt it was the 
parrot you know there goes friday running for his life to the little 
creek halloa hoop halloo 

then with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character 
he said in pity for his former self poor boy and cried again 

 wish scrooge muttered putting his hand in his pocket and looking 
about him after drying his eyes with his cuff but its too late now 

what is the matter asked the spirit 

nothing said scrooge nothing there was a boy singing a christmas 
carol at my door last night  should like to have given him something 
thats all 

the ghost smiled thoughtfully and waved its hand saying as it did so 
let us see another christmas 

scrooges former self grew larger at the words and the room became a 
little darker and more dirty the panels shrunk the windows cracked 
fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling and the naked laths were 
shown instead but how all this was brought about scrooge knew no more 
than you do he only knew that it was quite correct that everything had 
happened so that there he was alone again when all the other boys had 
gone home for the jolly holidays 

he was not reading now but walking up and down despairingly scrooge 
looked at the ghost and with a mournful shaking of his head glanced 
anxiously towards the door 

it opened and a little girl much younger than the boy came darting 
in and putting her arms about his neck and often kissing him 
addressed him as her dear dear brother 

 have come to bring you home dear brother said the child clapping 
her tiny hands and bending down to laugh to bring you home home 
home 

home little fan returned the boy 

yes said the child brimful of glee home for good and all home for 
ever and ever father is so much kinder than he used to be that homes 
like heaven he spoke so gently to me one dear night when  was going to 
bed that  was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home 
and he said yes you should and sent me in a coach to bring you and 
youre to be a man said the child opening her eyes and are never to 
come back here but first were to be together all the christmas long 
and have the merriest time in all the world 

you are quite a woman little fan exclaimed the boy 

she clapped her hands and laughed and tried to touch his head but 
being too little laughed again and stood on tiptoe to embrace him then 
she began to drag him in her childish eagerness towards the door and 
he nothing loath to go accompanied her 

 terrible voice in the hall cried bring down master scrooges box 
there and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself who glared on 
master scrooge with a ferocious condescension and threw him into a 
dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him he then conveyed him 
and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering best parlour 
that ever was seen where the maps upon the wall and the celestial and 
terrestrial globes in the windows were waxy with cold here he produced 
a decanter of curiously light wine and a block of curiously heavy cake 
and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people at 
the same time sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of 
something to the postboy who answered that he thanked the gentleman 
but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before he had rather not 
master scrooges trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the 
chaise the children bade the schoolmaster goodbye right willingly 
and getting into it drove gaily down the garden sweep the quick 
wheels dashing the hoarfrost and snow from off the dark leaves of the 
evergreens like spray 

illustration           
     

always a delicate creature whom a breath might have withered said 
the ghost but she had a large heart 

so she had cried scrooge youre right  will not gainsay it 
spirit god forbid 

she died a woman said the ghost and had as  think children 

one child scrooge returned 

true said the ghost your nephew 

scrooge seemed uneasy in his mind and answered briefly yes 

although they had but that moment left the school behind them they were 
now in the busy thoroughfares of a city where shadowy passengers passed 
and repassed where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way and 
all the strife and tumult of a real city were it was made plain enough 
by the dressing of the shops that here too it was christmastime 
again but it was evening and the streets were lighted up 

the ghost stopped at a certain warehouse door and asked scrooge if he 
knew it 

know it said scrooge was  apprenticed here 

they went in at sight of an old gentleman in a welsh wig sitting 
behind such a high desk that if he had been two inches taller he must 
have knocked his head against the ceiling scrooge cried in great 
excitement 

why its old fezziwig bless his heart its fezziwig alive again 

old fezziwig laid down his pen and looked up at the clock which 
pointed to the hour of seven he rubbed his hands adjusted his 
capacious waistcoat laughed all over himself from his shoes to his 
organ of benevolence and called out in a comfortable oily rich fat 
jovial voice 

yo ho there ebenezer dick 

scrooges former self now grown a young man came briskly in 
accompanied by his fellowprentice 

dick wilkins to be sure said scrooge to the ghost bless me yes 
there he is he was very much attached to me was dick poor dick dear 
dear 

yo ho my boys said fezziwig no more work tonight christmas eve 
dick christmas ebenezer lets have the shutters up cried old 
fezziwig with a sharp clap of his hands before a man can say jack 
robinson 

you wouldnt believe how those two fellows went at it they charged into 
the street with the shuttersone two threehad em up in their 
placesfour five sixbarred em and pinned emseven eight 
nineand came back before you could have got to twelve panting like 
racehorses 

hilliho cried old fezziwig skipping down from the high desk with 
wonderful agility clear away my lads and lets have lots of room 
here hilliho dick chirrup ebenezer 

clear away there was nothing they wouldnt have cleared away or 
couldnt have cleared away with old fezziwig looking on it was done in 
a minute every movable was packed off as if it were dismissed from 
public life for evermore the floor was swept and watered the lamps 
were trimmed fuel was heaped upon the fire and the warehouse was as 
snug and warm and dry and bright a ballroom as you would desire to 
see upon a winters night 

in came a fiddler with a musicbook and went up to the lofty desk and 
made an orchestra of it and tuned like fifty stomachaches in came 
mrs fezziwig one vast substantial smile in came the three miss 
fezziwigs beaming and lovable in came the six young followers whose 
hearts they broke in came all the young men and women employed in the 
business in came the housemaid with her cousin the baker in came the 
cook with her brothers particular friend the milkman in came the boy 
from over the way who was suspected of not having board enough from his 
master trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one 
who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress in they all 
came one after another some shyly some boldly some gracefully some 
awkwardly some pushing some pulling in they all came any how and 
every how away they all went twenty couple at once hands half round 
and back again the other way down the middle and up again round and 
round in various stages of affectionate grouping old top couple always 
turning up in the wrong place new top couple starting off again as soon 
as they got there all top couples at last and not a bottom one to help 
them when this result was brought about old fezziwig clapping his 
hands to stop the dance cried out well done and the fiddler plunged 
his hot face into a pot of porter especially provided for that purpose 
but scorning rest upon his reappearance he instantly began again 
though there were no dancers yet as if the other fiddler had been 
carried home exhausted on a shutter and he were a brannew man 
resolved to beat him out of sight or perish 

illustration then old fezziwig stood out to dance with mrs 
fezziwig 

there were more dances and there were forfeits and more dances and 
there was cake and there was negus and there was a great piece of cold 
roast and there was a great piece of cold boiled and there were 
mincepies and plenty of beer but the great effect of the evening came 
after the roast and boiled when the fiddler an artful dog mind the 
sort of man who knew his business better than you or  could have told 
it him struck up sir roger de coverley then old fezziwig stood 
out to dance with mrs fezziwig top couple too with a good stiff 
piece of work cut out for them three or four and twenty pair of 
partners people who were not to be trifled with people who would 
dance and had no notion of walking 

but if they had been twice as manyah four timesold fezziwig would 
have been a match for them and so would mrs fezziwig as to her she 
was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term if thats not 
high praise tell me higher and ill use it  positive light appeared 
to issue from fezziwigs calves they shone in every part of the dance 
like moons you couldnt have predicted at any given time what would 
become of them next and when old fezziwig and mrs fezziwig had gone 
all through the dance advance and retire both hands to your partner 
bow and curtsy corkscrew threadtheneedle and back again to your 
place fezziwig cutcut so deftly that he appeared to wink with his 
legs and came upon his feet again without a stagger 

when the clock struck eleven this domestic ball broke up mr and mrs 
fezziwig took their stations one on either side the door and shaking 
hands with every person individually as he or she went out wished him 
or her a merry christmas when everybody had retired but the two 
prentices they did the same to them and thus the cheerful voices died 
away and the lads were left to their beds which were under a counter 
in the backshop 

during the whole of this time scrooge had acted like a man out of his 
wits his heart and soul were in the scene and with his former self he 
corroborated everything remembered everything enjoyed everything and 
underwent the strangest agitation it was not until now when the bright 
faces of his former self and dick were turned from them that he 
remembered the ghost and became conscious that it was looking full upon 
him while the light upon its head burnt very clear 

 small matter said the ghost to make these silly folks so full of 
gratitude 

small echoed scrooge 

the spirit signed to him to listen to the two apprentices who were 
pouring out their hearts in praise of fezziwig and when he had done so 
said 

why is it not he has spent but a few pounds of your mortal money 
three or four perhaps is that so much that he deserves this praise 

it isnt that said scrooge heated by the remark and speaking 
unconsciously like his former not his latter self it isnt that 
spirit he has the power to render us happy or unhappy to make our 
service light or burdensome a pleasure or a toil say that his power 
lies in words and looks in things so slight and insignificant that it 
is impossible to add and count em up what then the happiness he gives 
is quite as great as if it cost a fortune 

he felt the spirits glance and stopped 

what is the matter asked the ghost 

nothing particular said scrooge 

something  think the ghost insisted 

no said scrooge no  should like to be able to say a word or two 
to my clerk just now thats all 

his former self turned down the lamps as he gave utterance to the wish 
and scrooge and the ghost again stood side by side in the open air 

my time grows short observed the spirit quick 

this was not addressed to scrooge or to any one whom he could see but 
it produced an immediate effect for again scrooge saw himself he was 
older now a man in the prime of life his face had not the harsh and 
rigid lines of later years but it had begun to wear the signs of care 
and avarice there was an eager greedy restless motion in the eye 
which showed the passion that had taken root and where the shadow of 
the growing tree would fall 

he was not alone but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourning 
dress in whose eyes there were tears which sparkled in the light that 
shone out of the ghost of christmas past 

it matters little she said softly to you very little another idol 
has displaced me and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come 
as  would have tried to do  have no just cause to grieve 

what idol has displaced you he rejoined 

 golden one 

this is the evenhanded dealing of the world he said there is 
nothing on which it is so hard as poverty and there is nothing it 
professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth 

you fear the world too much she answered gently all your other 
hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid 
reproach  have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one until 
the master passion gain engrosses you have  not 

what then he retorted even if  have grown so much wiser what 
then  am not changed towards you 

she shook her head 

am  

our contract is an old one it was made when we were both poor and 
content to be so until in good season we could improve our worldly 
fortune by our patient industry you are changed when it was made you 
were another man 

 was a boy he said impatiently 

your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are she 
returned  am that which promised happiness when we were one in heart 
is fraught with misery now that we are two how often and how keenly  
have thought of this  will not say it is enough that  have thought 
of it and can release you 

have  ever sought release 

in words no never 

in what then 

in a changed nature in an altered spirit in another atmosphere of 
life another hope as its great end in everything that made my love of 
any worth or value in your sight if this had never been between us 
said the girl looking mildly but with steadiness upon him tell me 
would you seek me out and try to win me now ah no 

he seemed to yield to the justice of this supposition in spite of 
himself but he said with a struggle you think not 

 would gladly think otherwise if  could she answered heaven 
knows when  have learned a truth like this  know how strong and 
irresistible it must be but if you were free today tomorrow 
yesterday can even  believe that you would choose a dowerless 
girlyou who in your very confidence with her weigh everything by 
gain or choosing her if for a moment you were false enough to your 
one guiding principle to do so do  not know that your repentance and 
regret would surely follow  do and  release you with a full heart 
for the love of him you once were 

illustration       

he was about to speak but with her head turned from him she resumed 

you maythe memory of what is past half makes me hope you willhave 
pain in this  very very brief time and you will dismiss the 
recollection of it gladly as an unprofitable dream from which it 
happened well that you awoke may you be happy in the life you have 
chosen 

she left him and they parted 

spirit said scrooge show me no more conduct me home why do you 
delight to torture me 

one shadow more exclaimed the ghost 

no more cried scrooge no more  dont wish to see it show me no 
more 

but the relentless ghost pinioned him in both his arms and forced him 
to observe what happened next 

they were in another scene and place a room not very large or 
handsome but full of comfort near to the winter fire sat a beautiful 
young girl so like that last that scrooge believed it was the same 
until he saw her now a comely matron sitting opposite her daughter 
the noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous for there were more 
children there than scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count 
and unlike the celebrated herd in the poem they were not forty 
children conducting themselves like one but every child was conducting 
itself like forty the consequences were uproarious beyond belief but 
no one seemed to care on the contrary the mother and daughter laughed 
heartily and enjoyed it very much and the latter soon beginning to 
mingle in the sports got pillaged by the young brigands most 
ruthlessly what would  not have given to be one of them though  
never could have been so rude no no  wouldnt for the wealth of all 
the world have crushed that braided hair and torn it down and for the 
precious little shoe  wouldnt have plucked it off god bless my soul 
to save my life as to measuring her waist in sport as they did bold 
young brood  couldnt have done it  should have expected my arm to 
have grown round it for a punishment and never come straight again and 
yet  should have dearly liked  own to have touched her lips to have 
questioned her that she might have opened them to have looked upon the 
lashes of her downcast eyes and never raised a blush to have let loose 
waves of hair an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price in 
short  should have liked  do confess to have had the lightest 
license of a child and yet to have been man enough to know its value 

illustration  flushed and boisterous group 

but now a knocking at the door was heard and such a rush immediately 
ensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress was borne 
towards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group just in time to 
greet the father who came home attended by a man laden with christmas 
toys and presents then the shouting and the struggling and the 
onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter the scaling him with 
chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets despoil him of 
brownpaper parcels hold on tight by his cravat hug him round his 
neck pummel his back and kick his legs in irrepressible affection the 
shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package 
was received the terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in 
the act of putting a dolls frying pan into his mouth and was more than 
suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey glued on a wooden 
platter the immense relief of finding this a false alarm the joy and 
gratitude and ecstasy they are all indescribable alike it is enough 
that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of the 
parlour and by one stair at a time up to the top of the house where 
they went to bed and so subsided 

and now scrooge looked on more attentively than ever when the master of 
the house having his daughter leaning fondly on him sat down with her 
and her mother at his own fireside and when he thought that such 
another creature quite as graceful and as full of promise might have 
called him father and been a springtime in the haggard winter of his 
life his sight grew very dim indeed 

belle said the husband turning to his wife with a smile  saw an 
old friend of yours this afternoon 

who was it 

guess 

how can  tut dont  know she added in the same breath laughing 
as he laughed mr scrooge 

mr scrooge it was  passed his office window and as it was not shut 
up and he had a candle inside  could scarcely help seeing him his 
partner lies upon the point of death  hear and there he sat alone 
quite alone in the world  do believe 

spirit said scrooge in a broken voice remove me from this place 

 told you these were shadows of the things that have been said the 
ghost that they are what they are do not blame me 

remove me scrooge exclaimed  cannot bear it 

he turned upon the ghost and seeing that it looked upon him with a 
face in which in some strange way there were fragments of all the faces 
it had shown him wrestled with it 

leave me take me back haunt me no longer 

in the struggle if that can be called a struggle in which the ghost 
with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort 
of its adversary scrooge observed that its light was burning high and 
bright and dimly connecting that with its influence over him he seized 
the extinguishercap and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its 
head 

illustration laden with christmas toys and presents 

the spirit dropped beneath it so that the extinguisher covered its 
whole form but though scrooge pressed it down with all his force he 
could not hide the light which streamed from under it in an unbroken 
flood upon the ground 

he was conscious of being exhausted and overcome by an irresistible 
drowsiness and further of being in his own bedroom he gave the cap a 
parting squeeze in which his hand relaxed and had barely time to reel 
to bed before he sank into a heavy sleep

awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore and sitting up in 
bed to get his thoughts together scrooge had no occasion to be told 
that the bell was again upon the stroke of one he felt that he was 
restored to consciousness in the right nick of time for the especial 
purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to 
him through jacob marleys intervention but finding that he turned 
uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this 
new spectre would draw back he put them every one aside with his own 
hands and lying down again established a sharp lookout all round the 
bed for he wished to challenge the spirit on the moment of its 
appearance and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous 

gentlemen of the freeandeasy sort who plume themselves on being 
acquainted with a move or two and being usually equal to the time of 
day express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing 
that they are good for anything from pitchandtoss to manslaughter 
between which opposite extremes no doubt there lies a tolerably wide 
and comprehensive range of subjects without venturing for scrooge quite 
as hardily as this  dont mind calling on you to believe that he was 
ready for a good broad field of strange appearances and that nothing 
between a baby and a rhinoceros would have astonished him very much 

now being prepared for almost anything he was not by any means 
prepared for nothing and consequently when the bell struck one and no 
shape appeared he was taken with a violent fit of trembling five 
minutes ten minutes a quarter of an hour went by yet nothing came 
all this time he lay upon his bed the very core and centre of a blaze 
of ruddy light which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the 
hour and which being only light was more alarming than a dozen 
ghosts as he was powerless to make out what it meant or would be at 
and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an 
interesting case of spontaneous combustion without having the 
consolation of knowing it at last however he began to thinkas you 
or  would have thought at first for it is always the person not in the 
predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it and would 
unquestionably have done it tooat last  say he began to think that 
the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining 
room from whence on further tracing it it seemed to shine this idea 
taking full possession of his mind he got up softly and shuffled in 
his slippers to the door 

the moment scrooges hand was on the lock a strange voice called him by 
his name and bade him enter he obeyed 

it was his own room there was no doubt about that but it had undergone 
a surprising transformation the walls and ceiling were so hung with 
living green that it looked a perfect grove from every part of which 
bright gleaming berries glistened the crisp leaves of holly mistletoe 
and ivy reflected back the light as if so many little mirrors had been 
scattered there and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as 
that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in scrooges time 
or marleys or for many and many a winter season gone heaped up on the 
floor to form a kind of throne were turkeys geese game poultry 
brawn great joints of meat suckingpigs long wreaths of sausages 
mincepies plumpuddings barrels of oysters redhot chestnuts 
cherrycheeked apples juicy oranges luscious pears immense 
twelfthcakes and seething bowls of punch that made the chamber dim 
with their delicious steam in easy state upon this couch there sat a 
jolly giant glorious to see who bore a glowing torch in shape not 
unlike plentys horn and held it up high up to shed its light on 
scrooge as he came peeping round the door 

come in exclaimed the ghost come in and know me better man 

scrooge entered timidly and hung his head before this spirit he was 
not the dogged scrooge he had been and though the spirits eyes were 
clear and kind he did not like to meet them 

 am the ghost of christmas present said the spirit look upon me 

scrooge reverently did so it was clothed in one simple deep green robe 
or mantle bordered with white fur this garment hung so loosely on the 
figure that its capacious breast was bare as if disdaining to be 
warded or concealed by any artifice its feet observable beneath the 
ample folds of the garment were also bare and on its head it wore no 
other covering than a holly wreath set here and there with shining 
icicles its darkbrown curls were long and free free as its genial 
face its sparkling eye its open hand its cheery voice its 
unconstrained demeanour and its joyful air girded round its middle was 
an antique scabbard but no sword was in it and the ancient sheath was 
eaten up with rust 

you have never seen the like of me before exclaimed the spirit 

never scrooge made answer to it 

have never walked forth with the younger members of my family meaning 
for  am very young my elder brothers born in these later years 
pursued the phantom 

 dont think  have said scrooge  am afraid  have not have you 
had many brothers spirit 

more than eighteen hundred said the ghost 

 tremendous family to provide for muttered scrooge 

the ghost of christmas present rose 

spirit said scrooge submissively conduct me where you will  went 
forth last night on compulsion and  learned a lesson which is working 
now tonight if you have aught to teach me let me profit by it 

touch my robe 

scrooge did as he was told and held it fast 

holly mistletoe red berries ivy turkeys geese game poultry 
brawn meat pigs sausages oysters pies puddings fruit and punch 
all vanished instantly so did the room the fire the ruddy glow the 
hour of night and they stood in the city streets on christmas morning 
where for the weather was severe the people made a rough but brisk 
and not unpleasant kind of music in scraping the snow from the pavement 
in front of their dwellings and from the tops of their houses whence 
it was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the 
road below and splitting into artificial little snowstorms 

the housefronts looked black enough and the windows blacker 
contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs and with 
the dirtier snow upon the ground which last deposit had been ploughed 
up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons furrows 
that crossed and recrossed each other hundreds of times where the great 
streets branched off and made intricate channels hard to trace in the 
thick yellow mud and icy water the sky was gloomy and the shortest 
streets were choked up with a dingy mist half thawed half frozen 
whose heavier particles descended in a shower of sooty atoms as if all 
the chimneys in great britain had by one consent caught fire and were 
blazing away to their dear hearts content there was nothing very 
cheerful in the climate or the town and yet was there an air of 
cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer 
sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain 

illustration         

for the people who were shovelling away on the housetops were jovial 
and full of glee calling out to one another from the parapets and now 
and then exchanging a facetious snowballbetternatured missile far 
than many a wordy jestlaughing heartily if it went right and not less 
heartily if it went wrong the poulterers shops were still half open 
and the fruiterers were radiant in their glory there were great 
round potbellied baskets of chestnuts shaped like the waistcoats of 
jolly old gentlemen lolling at the doors and tumbling out into the 
street in their apoplectic opulence there were ruddy brownfaced 
broadgirthed spanish onions shining in the fatness of their growth 
like spanish friars and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at 
the girls as they went by and glanced demurely at the hungup 
mistletoe there were pears and apples clustered high in blooming 
pyramids there were bunches of grapes made in the shopkeepers 
benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks that peoples mouths might 
water gratis as they passed there were piles of filberts mossy and 
brown recalling in their fragrance ancient walks among the woods and 
pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves there were 
norfolk biffins squab and swarthy setting off the yellow of the 
oranges and lemons and in the great compactness of their juicy 
persons urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper 
bags and eaten after dinner the very gold and silver fish set forth 
among these choice fruits in a bowl though members of a dull and 
stagnantblooded race appeared to know that there was something going 
on and to a fish went gasping round and round their little world in 
slow and passionless excitement 

the grocers oh the grocers nearly closed with perhaps two shutters 
down or one but through those gaps such glimpses it was not alone 
that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound or that 
the twine and roller parted company so briskly or that the canisters 
were rattled up and down like juggling tricks or even that the blended 
scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose or even that the 
raisins were so plentiful and rare the almonds so extremely white the 
sticks of cinnamon so long and straight the other spices so delicious 
the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the 
coldest lookerson feel faint and subsequently bilious nor was it that 
the figs were moist and pulpy or that the french plums blushed in 
modest tartness from their highlydecorated boxes or that everything 
was good to eat and in its christmas dress but the customers were all 
so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day that they 
tumbled up against each other at the door crashing their wicker baskets 
wildly and left their purchases upon the counter and came running 
back to fetch them and committed hundreds of the like mistakes in the 
best humour possible while the grocer and his people were so frank and 
fresh that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons 
behind might have been their own worn outside for general inspection 
and for christmas daws to peck at if they chose 

but soon the steeples called good people all to church and chapel and 
away they came flocking through the streets in their best clothes and 
with their gayest faces and at the same time there emerged from scores 
of bystreets lanes and nameless turnings innumerable people 
carrying their dinners to the bakers shops the sight of these poor 
revellers appeared to interest the spirit very much for he stood with 
scrooge beside him in a bakers doorway and taking off the covers as 
their bearers passed sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch 
and it was a very uncommon kind of torch for once or twice when there 
were angry words between some dinnercarriers who had jostled each 
other he shed a few drops of water on them from it and their 
goodhumour was restored directly for they said it was a shame to 
quarrel upon christmas day and so it was god love it so it was 

in time the bells ceased and the bakers were shut up and yet there was 
a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their 
cooking in the thawed blotch of wet above each bakers oven where the 
pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too 

is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch 
asked scrooge 

there is my own 

would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day asked scrooge 

to any kindly given to a poor one most 

why to a poor one most asked scrooge 

because it needs it most 

spirit said scrooge after a moments thought  wonder you of all 
the beings in the many worlds about us should desire to cramp these 
peoples opportunities of innocent enjoyment 

 cried the spirit 

you would deprive them of their means of dining every seventh day 
often the only day on which they can be said to dine at all said 
scrooge wouldnt you 

 cried the spirit 

you seek to close these places on the seventh day said scrooge and 
it comes to the same thing 

 seek exclaimed the spirit 

forgive me if  am wrong it has been done in your name or at least in 
that of your family said scrooge 

there are some upon this earth of yours returned the spirit who 
lay claim to know us and who do their deeds of passion pride 
illwill hatred envy bigotry and selfishness in our name who are as 
strange to us and all our kith and kin as if they had never lived 
remember that and charge their doings on themselves not us 

scrooge promised that he would and they went on invisible as they had 
been before into the suburbs of the town it was a remarkable quality 
of the ghost which scrooge had observed at the bakers that 
notwithstanding his gigantic size he could accommodate himself to any 
place with ease and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as 
gracefully and like a supernatural creature as it was possible he could 
have done in any lofty hall 

and perhaps it was the pleasure the good spirit had in showing off this 
power of his or else it was his own kind generous hearty nature and 
his sympathy with all poor men that led him straight to scrooges 
clerks for there he went and took scrooge with him holding to his 
robe and on the threshold of the door the spirit smiled and stopped to 
bless bob cratchits dwelling with the sprinklings of his torch think 
of that bob had but fifteen bob a week himself he pocketed on 
saturdays but fifteen copies of his christian name and yet the ghost of 
christmas present blessed his fourroomed house 

then up rose mrs cratchit cratchits wife dressed out but poorly in a 
twiceturned gown but brave in ribbons which are cheap and make a 
goodly show for sixpence and she laid the cloth assisted by belinda 
cratchit second of her daughters also brave in ribbons while master 
peter cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes and getting 
the corners of his monstrous shirtcollar bobs private property 
conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day into his mouth 
rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired and yearned to show his 
linen in the fashionable parks and now two smaller cratchits boy and 
girl came tearing in screaming that outside the bakers they had smelt 
the goose and known it for their own and basking in luxurious thoughts 
of sage and onion these young cratchits danced about the table and 
exalted master peter cratchit to the skies while he not proud 
although his collars nearly choked him blew the fire until the slow 
potatoes bubbling up knocked loudly at the saucepanlid to be let out 
and peeled 

what has ever got your precious father then said mrs cratchit and 
your brother tiny tim and martha warnt as late last christmas day by 
half an hour 

heres martha mother said a girl appearing as she spoke 

heres martha mother cried the two young cratchits hurrah theres 
such a goose martha 

why bless your heart alive my dear how late you are said mrs 
cratchit kissing her a dozen times and taking off her shawl and bonnet 
for her with officious zeal 

wed a deal of work to finish up last night replied the girl and 
had to clear away this morning mother 

well never mind so long as you are come said mrs cratchit sit ye 
down before the fire my dear and have a warm lord bless ye 

no no theres father coming cried the two young cratchits who were 
everywhere at once hide martha hide 

so martha hid herself and in came little bob the father with at least 
three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe hanging down before 
him and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed to look 
seasonable and tiny tim upon his shoulder alas for tiny tim he bore a 
little crutch and had his limbs supported by an iron frame 

why wheres our martha cried bob cratchit looking round 

not coming said mrs cratchit 

not coming said bob with a sudden declension in his high spirits 
for he had been tims bloodhorse all the way from church and had come 
home rampant not coming upon christmas day 

martha didnt like to see him disappointed if it were only in joke so 
she came out prematurely from behind the closet door and ran into his 
arms while the two young cratchits hustled tiny tim and bore him off 
into the washhouse that he might hear the pudding singing in the 
copper 

and how did little tim behave asked mrs cratchit when she had 
rallied bob on his credulity and bob had hugged his daughter to his 
hearts content 

as good as gold said bob and better somehow he gets thoughtful 
sitting by himself so much and thinks the strangest things you ever 
heard he told me coming home that he hoped the people saw him in the 
church because he was a cripple and it might be pleasant to them to 
remember upon christmas day who made lame beggars walk and blind men 
see 

bobs voice was tremulous when he told them this and trembled more when 
he said that tiny tim was growing strong and hearty 

his active little crutch was heard upon the floor and back came tiny 
tim before another word was spoken escorted by his brother and 
sister to his stool beside the fire and while bob turning up his 
cuffsas if poor fellow they were capable of being made more 
shabbycompounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons and 
stirred it round and round and put it on the hob to simmer master 
peter and the two ubiquitous young cratchits went to fetch the goose 
with which they soon returned in high procession 

illustration 

such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of 
all birds a feathered phenomenon to which a black swan was a matter of 
courseand in truth it was something very like it in that house mrs 
cratchit made the gravy ready beforehand in a little saucepan hissing 
hot master peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour miss 
belinda sweetened up the apple sauce martha dusted the hot plates bob 
took tiny tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table the two young 
cratchits set chairs for everybody not forgetting themselves and 
mounting guard upon their posts crammed spoons into their mouths lest 
they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped at 
last the dishes were set on and grace was said it was succeeded by a 
breathless pause as mrs cratchit looking slowly all along the 
carvingknife prepared to plunge it in the breast but when she did 
and when the longexpected gush of stuffing issued forth one murmur of 
delight arose all round the board and even tiny tim excited by the two 
young cratchits beat on the table with the handle of his knife and 
feebly cried hurrah 

illustration           

there never was such a goose bob said he didnt believe there ever was 
such a goose cooked its tenderness and flavour size and cheapness 
were the themes of universal admiration eked out by apple sauce and 
mashed potatoes it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family 
indeed as mrs cratchit said with great delight surveying one small 
atom of a bone upon the dish they hadnt ate it all at last yet every 
one had had enough and the youngest cratchits in particular were 
steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows but now the plates being 
changed by miss belinda mrs cratchit left the room alonetoo nervous 
to bear witnessesto take the pudding up and bring it in 

suppose it should not be done enough suppose it should break in turning 
out suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the backyard and 
stolen it while they were merry with the goosea supposition at which 
the two young cratchits became livid all sorts of horrors were 
supposed 

hallo  great deal of steam the pudding was out of the copper  smell 
like a washingday that was the cloth  smell like an eatinghouse and 
a pastrycooks next door to each other with a laundresss next door to 
that that was the pudding in half a minute mrs cratchit 
enteredflushed but smiling proudlywith the pudding like a speckled 
cannonball so hard and firm blazing in half of halfaquartern of 
ignited brandy and bedight with christmas holly stuck into the top 

oh a wonderful pudding bob cratchit said and calmly too that he 
regarded it as the greatest success achieved by mrs cratchit since 
their marriage mrs cratchit said that now the weight was off her 
mind she would confess she had her doubts about the quantity of flour 
everybody had something to say about it but nobody said or thought it 
was at all a small pudding for a large family it would have been flat 
heresy to do so any cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a 
thing 

illustration    

at last the dinner was all done the cloth was cleared the hearth 
swept and the fire made up the compound in the jug being tasted and 
considered perfect apples and oranges were put upon the table and a 
shovel full of chestnuts on the fire then all the cratchit family 
drew round the hearth in what bob cratchit called a circle meaning half 
a one and at bob cratchits elbow stood the family display of glass 
two tumblers and a custard cup without a handle 

these held the hot stuff from the jug however as well as golden 
goblets would have done and bob served it out with beaming looks while 
the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily then bob 
proposed 

 merry christmas to us all my dears god bless us 

which all the family reechoed 

god bless us every one said tiny tim the last of all 

he sat very close to his fathers side upon his little stool bob held 
his withered little hand to his as if he loved the child and wished to 
keep him by his side and dreaded that he might be taken from him 

spirit said scrooge with an interest he had never felt before tell 
me if tiny tim will live 

 see a vacant seat replied the ghost in the poor chimney corner 
and a crutch without an owner carefully preserved if these shadows 
remain unaltered by the future the child will die 

no no said scrooge oh no kind spirit say he will be spared 

if these shadows remain unaltered by the future none other of my race 
returned the ghost will find him here what then if he be like to 
die he had better do it and decrease the surplus population 

scrooge hung his head to hear his own words quoted by the spirit and 
was overcome with penitence and grief 

man said the ghost if man you be in heart not adamant forbear 
that wicked cant until you have discovered what the surplus is and 
where it is will you decide what men shall live what men shall die it 
may be that in the sight of heaven you are more worthless and less fit 
to live than millions like this poor mans child  god to hear the 
insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry 
brothers in the dust 

scrooge bent before the ghosts rebuke and trembling cast his eyes 
upon the ground but he raised them speedily on hearing his own name 

mr scrooge said bob ill give you mr scrooge the founder of the 
feast 

the founder of the feast indeed cried mrs cratchit reddening  
wish  had him here id give him a piece of my mind to feast upon and 
 hope hed have a good appetite for it 

my dear said bob the children christmas day 

it should be christmas day  am sure said she on which one drinks 
the health of such an odious stingy hard unfeeling man as mr 
scrooge you know he is robert nobody knows it better than you do 
poor fellow 

my dear was bobs mild answer christmas day 

ill drink his health for your sake and the days said mrs cratchit 
not for his long life to him  merry christmas and a happy new year 
hell be very merry and very happy  have no doubt 

the children drank the toast after her it was the first of their 
proceedings which had no heartiness in it tiny tim drank it last of 
all but he didnt care twopence for it scrooge was the ogre of the 
family the mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party which 
was not dispelled for full five minutes 

after it had passed away they were ten times merrier than before from 
the mere relief of scrooge the baleful being done with bob cratchit 
told them how he had a situation in his eye for master peter which 
would bring in if obtained full fiveandsixpence weekly the two 
young cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of peters being a man 
of business and peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from 
between his collars as if he were deliberating what particular 
investments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that 
bewildering income martha who was a poor apprentice at a milliners 
then told them what kind of work she had to do and how many hours she 
worked at a stretch and how she meant to lie abed tomorrow morning for 
a good long rest tomorrow being a holiday she passed at home also how 
she had seen a countess and a lord some days before and how the lord 
was much about as tall as peter at which peter pulled up his collar 
so high that you couldnt have seen his head if you had been there all 
this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round and byandby 
they had a song about a lost child travelling in the snow from tiny 
tim who had a plaintive little voice and sang it very well indeed 

there was nothing of high mark in this they were not a handsome family 
they were not well dressed their shoes were far from being waterproof 
their clothes were scanty and peter might have known and very likely 
did the inside of a pawnbrokers but they were happy grateful 
pleased with one another and contented with the time and when they 
faded and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the spirits 
torch at parting scrooge had his eye upon them and especially on tiny 
tim until the last 

by this time it was getting dark and snowing pretty heavily and as 
scrooge and the spirit went along the streets the brightness of the 
roaring fires in kitchens parlours and all sorts of rooms was 
wonderful here the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a 
cosy dinner with hot plates baking through and through before the fire 
and deep red curtains ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness 
there all the children of the house were running out into the snow to 
meet their married sisters brothers cousins uncles aunts and be the 
first to greet them here again were shadows on the windowblinds of 
guests assembling and there a group of handsome girls all hooded and 
furbooted and all chattering at once tripped lightly off to some near 
neighbours house where woe upon the single man who saw them 
enterartful witches well they knew itin a glow 

but if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to 
friendly gatherings you might have thought that no one was at home to 
give them welcome when they got there instead of every house expecting 
company and piling up its fires halfchimney high blessings on it how 
the ghost exulted how it bared its breadth of breast and opened its 
capacious palm and floated on outpouring with a generous hand its 
bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach the very 
lamplighter who ran on before dotting the dusky street with specks of 
light and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere laughed out 
loudly as the spirit passed though little kenned the lamplighter that 
he had any company but christmas 

and now without a word of warning from the ghost they stood upon a 
bleak and desert moor where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast 
about as though it were the burialplace of giants and water spread 
itself wheresoever it listed or would have done so but for the frost 
that held it prisoner and nothing grew but moss and furze and coarse 
rank grass down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery 
red which glared upon the desolation for an instant like a sullen eye 
and frowning lower lower lower yet was lost in the thick gloom of 
darkest night 

what place is this asked scrooge 

 place where miners live who labour in the bowels of the earth 
returned the spirit but they know me see 

 light shone from the window of a hut and swiftly they advanced 
towards it passing through the wall of mud and stone they found a 
cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire an old old man and 
woman with their children and their childrens children and another 
generation beyond that all decked out gaily in their holiday attire 
the old man in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind 
upon the barren waste was singing them a christmas song it had been a 
very old song when he was a boy and from time to time they all joined 
in the chorus so surely as they raised their voices the old man got 
quite blithe and loud and so surely as they stopped his vigour sank 
again 

the spirit did not tarry here but bade scrooge hold his robe and 
passing on above the moor sped whither not to sea to sea to 
scrooges horror looking back he saw the last of the land a frightful 
range of rocks behind them and his ears were deafened by the 
thundering of water as it rolled and roared and raged among the 
dreadful caverns it had worn and fiercely tried to undermine the earth 

built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks some league or so from shore 
on which the waters chafed and dashed the wild year through there 
stood a solitary lighthouse great heaps of seaweed clung to its base 
and stormbirdsborn of the wind one might suppose as seaweed of the 
waterrose and fell about it like the waves they skimmed 

but even here two men who watched the light had made a fire that 
through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of 
brightness on the awful sea joining their horny hands over the rough 
table at which they sat they wished each other merry christmas in their 
can of grog and one of themthe elder too with his face all damaged 
and scarred with hard weather as the figurehead of an old ship might 
bestruck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself 

again the ghost sped on above the black and heaving seaon onuntil 
being far away as he told scrooge from any shore they lighted on a 
ship they stood beside the helmsman at the wheel the lookout in the 
bow the officers who had the watch dark ghostly figures in their 
several stations but every man among them hummed a christmas tune or 
had a christmas thought or spoke below his breath to his companion of 
some bygone christmas day with homeward hopes belonging to it and 
every man on board waking or sleeping good or bad had had a kinder 
word for one another on that day than on any day in the year and had 
shared to some extent in its festivities and had remembered those he 
cared for at a distance and had known that they delighted to remember 
him 

it was a great surprise to scrooge while listening to the moaning of 
the wind and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the 
lonely darkness over an unknown abyss whose depths were secrets as 
profound as death it was a great surprise to scrooge while thus 
engaged to hear a hearty laugh it was a much greater surprise to 
scrooge to recognise it as his own nephews and to find himself in a 
bright dry gleaming room with the spirit standing smiling by his 
side and looking at that same nephew with approving affability 

ha ha laughed scrooges nephew ha ha ha 

if you should happen by any unlikely chance to know a man more blessed 
in a laugh than scrooges nephew all  can say is  should like to 
know him too introduce him to me and ill cultivate his acquaintance 

it is a fair evenhanded noble adjustment of things that while there 
is infection in disease and sorrow there is nothing in the world so 
irresistibly contagious as laughter and goodhumour when scrooges 
nephew laughed in this wayholding his sides rolling his head and 
twisting his face into the most extravagant contortionsscrooges 
niece by marriage laughed as heartily as he and their assembled 
friends being not a bit behindhand roared out lustily 

ha ha ha ha ha ha 

he said that christmas was a humbug as  live cried scrooges 
nephew he believed it too 

more shame for him fred said scrooges niece indignantly bless 
those women they never do anything by halves they are always in 
earnest 

she was very pretty exceedingly pretty with a dimpled 
surprisedlooking capital face a ripe little mouth that seemed made 
to be kissedas no doubt it was all kinds of good little dots about 
her chin that melted into one another when she laughed and the 
sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creatures head 
altogether she was what you would have called provoking you know but 
satisfactory too oh perfectly satisfactory 

hes a comical old fellow said scrooges nephew thats the truth 
and not so pleasant as he might be however his offences carry their 
own punishment and  have nothing to say against him 

im sure he is very rich fred hinted scrooges niece at least you 
always tell me so 

what of that my dear said scrooges nephew his wealth is of no use 
to him he dont do any good with it he dont make himself comfortable 
with it he hasnt the satisfaction of thinkingha ha hathat he is 
ever going to benefit us with it 

 have no patience with him observed scrooges niece scrooges 
nieces sisters and all the other ladies expressed the same opinion 

oh  have said scrooges nephew  am sorry for him  couldnt be 
angry with him if  tried who suffers by his ill whims himself always 
here he takes it into his head to dislike us and he wont come and dine 
with us whats the consequence he dont lose much of a dinner 

indeed  think he loses a very good dinner interrupted scrooges 
niece everybody else said the same and they must be allowed to have 
been competent judges because they had just had dinner and with the 
dessert upon the table were clustered round the fire by lamplight 

well  am very glad to hear it said scrooges nephew because  
havent any great faith in these young housekeepers what do you say 
topper 

topper had clearly got his eye upon one of scrooges nieces sisters 
for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast who had no right 
to express an opinion on the subject whereat scrooges nieces 
sisterthe plump one with the lace tucker not the one with the 
rosesblushed 

do go on fred said scrooges niece clapping her hands he never 
finishes what he begins to say he is such a ridiculous fellow 

scrooges nephew revelled in another laugh and as it was impossible to 
keep the infection off though the plump sister tried hard to do it with 
aromatic vinegar his example was unanimously followed 

 was only going to say said scrooges nephew that the consequence 
of his taking a dislike to us and not making merry with us is as  
think that he loses some pleasant moments which could do him no harm 
 am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own 
thoughts either in his mouldy old office or his dusty chambers  mean 
to give him the same chance every year whether he likes it or not for 
 pity him he may rail at christmas till he dies but he cant help 
thinking better of iti defy himif he finds me going there in good 
temper year after year and saying uncle scrooge how are you if it 
only put him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds thats 
something and  think  shook him yesterday 

it was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking scrooge 
but being thoroughly goodnatured and not much caring what they laughed 
at so that they laughed at any rate he encouraged them in their 
merriment and passed the bottle joyously 

after tea they had some music for they were a musical family and knew 
what they were about when they sung a glee or catch  can assure you 
especially topper who could growl away in the bass like a good one and 
never swell the large veins in his forehead or get red in the face over 
it scrooges niece played well upon the harp and played among other 
tunes a simple little air a mere nothing you might learn to whistle 
it in two minutes which had been familiar to the child who fetched 
scrooge from the boardingschool as he had been reminded by the ghost 
of christmas past when this strain of music sounded all the things 
that ghost had shown him came upon his mind he softened more and more 
and thought that if he could have listened to it often years ago he 
might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with 
his own hands without resorting to the sextons spade that buried jacob 
marley 

illustration the way he went after that plump sister in the lace 
tucker 

but they didnt devote the whole evening to music after a while they 
played at forfeits for it is good to be children sometimes and never 
better than at christmas when its mighty founder was a child himself 
stop there was first a game at blind mansbuff of course there was 
and  no more believe topper was really blind than  believe he had eyes 
in his boots my opinion is that it was a done thing between him and 
scrooges nephew and that the ghost of christmas present knew it the 
way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on 
the credulity of human nature knocking down the fireirons tumbling 
over the chairs bumping up against the piano smothering himself 
amongst the curtains wherever she went there went he he always knew 
where the plump sister was he wouldnt catch anybody else if you had 
fallen up against him as some of them did on purpose he would have 
made a feint of endeavouring to seize you which would have been an 
affront to your understanding and would instantly have sidled off in 
the direction of the plump sister she often cried out that it wasnt 
fair and it really was not but when at last he caught her when in 
spite of all her silken rustlings and her rapid flutterings past him 
he got her into a corner whence there was no escape then his conduct 
was the most execrable for his pretending not to know her his 
pretending that it was necessary to touch her headdress and further to 
assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her 
finger and a certain chain about her neck was vile monstrous no 
doubt she told him her opinion of it when another blind man being in 
office they were so very confidential together behind the curtains 

scrooges niece was not one of the blind mansbuff party but was made 
comfortable with a large chair and a footstool in a snug corner where 
the ghost and scrooge were close behind her but she joined in the 
forfeits and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the 
alphabet likewise at the game of how when and where she was very 
great and to the secret joy of scrooges nephew beat her sisters 
hollow though they were sharp girls too as topper could have told you 
there might have been twenty people there young and old but they all 
played and so did scrooge for wholly forgetting in the interest he 
had in what was going on that his voice made no sound in their ears he 
sometimes came out with his guess quite loud and very often guessed 
right too for the sharpest needle best whitechapel warranted not to 
cut in the eye was not sharper than scrooge blunt as he took it in 
his head to be 

the ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood and looked upon 
him with such favour that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay 
until the guests departed but this the spirit said could not be done 

here is a new game said scrooge one halfhour spirit only one 

it was a game called yes and no where scrooges nephew had to think of 
something and the rest must find out what he only answering to their 
questions yes or no as the case was the brisk fire of questioning to 
which he was exposed elicited from him that he was thinking of an 
animal a live animal rather a disagreeable animal a savage animal an 
animal that growled and grunted sometimes and talked sometimes and 
lived in london and walked about the streets and wasnt made a show 
of and wasnt led by anybody and didnt live in a menagerie and was 
never killed in a market and was not a horse or an ass or a cow or a 
bull or a tiger or a dog or a pig or a cat or a bear at every 
fresh question that was put to him this nephew burst into a fresh roar 
of laughter and was so inexpressibly tickled that he was obliged to 
get up off the sofa and stamp at last the plump sister falling into a 
similar state cried out 

 have found it out  know what it is fred  know what it is 

what is it cried fred 

its your uncle scroooooge 

which it certainly was admiration was the universal sentiment though 
some objected that the reply to is it a bear ought to have been 
yes inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have 
diverted their thoughts from mr scrooge supposing they had ever had 
any tendency that way 

he has given us plenty of merriment  am sure said fred and it 
would be ungrateful not to drink his health here is a glass of mulled 
wine ready to our hand at the moment and  say uncle scrooge 

well uncle scrooge they cried 

 merry christmas and a happy new year to the old man whatever he is 
said scrooges nephew he wouldnt take it from me but may he have it 
nevertheless uncle scrooge 

uncle scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart that 
he would have pledged the unconscious company in return and thanked 
them in an inaudible speech if the ghost had given him time but the 
whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his 
nephew and he and the spirit were again upon their travels 

much they saw and far they went and many homes they visited but 
always with a happy end the spirit stood beside sickbeds and they 
were cheerful on foreign lands and they were close at home by 
struggling men and they were patient in their greater hope by poverty 
and it was rich in almshouse hospital and gaol in miserys every 
refuge where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast 
the door and barred the spirit out he left his blessing and taught 
scrooge his precepts 

it was a long night if it were only a night but scrooge had his doubts 
of this because the christmas holidays appeared to be condensed into 
the space of time they passed together it was strange too that while 
scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form the ghost grew older 
clearly older scrooge had observed this change but never spoke of it 
until they left a childrens twelfthnight party when looking at the 
spirit as they stood together in an open place he noticed that its hair 
was grey 

are spirits lives so short asked scrooge 

my life upon this globe is very brief replied the ghost it ends 
tonight 

tonight cried scrooge 

tonight at midnight hark the time is drawing near 

the chimes were ringing the threequarters past eleven at that moment 

forgive me if  am not justified in what  ask said scrooge looking 
intently at the spirits robe but  see something strange and not 
belonging to yourself protruding from your skirts is it a foot or a 
claw 

it might be a claw for the flesh there is upon it was the spirits 
sorrowful reply look here 

from the foldings of its robe it brought two children wretched abject 
frightful hideous miserable they knelt down at its feet and clung 
upon the outside of its garment 

 man look here look look down here exclaimed the ghost 

they were a boy and girl yellow meagre ragged scowling wolfish but 
prostrate too in their humility where graceful youth should have 
filled their features out and touched them with its freshest tints a 
stale and shrivelled hand like that of age had pinched and twisted 
them and pulled them into shreds where angels might have sat 
enthroned devils lurked and glared out menacing no change no 
degradation no perversion of humanity in any grade through all the 
mysteries of wonderful creation has monsters half so horrible and 
dread 

scrooge started back appalled having them shown to him in this way he 
tried to say they were fine children but the words choked themselves 
rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude 

spirit are they yours scrooge could say no more 

they are mans said the spirit looking down upon them and they 
cling to me appealing from their fathers this boy is ignorance this 
girl is want beware of them both and all of their degree but most of 
all beware this boy for on his brow  see that written which is doom 
unless the writing be erased deny it cried the spirit stretching out 
his hand towards the city slander those who tell it ye admit it for 
your factious purposes and make it worse and bide the end 

have they no refuge or resource cried scrooge 

are there no prisons said the spirit turning on him for the last 
time with his own words are there no workhouses 

the bell struck twelve 

scrooge looked about him for the ghost and saw it not as the last 
stroke ceased to vibrate he remembered the prediction of old jacob 
marley and lifting up his eyes beheld a solemn phantom draped and 
hooded coming like a mist along the ground towards him 


  




     


the phantom slowly gravely silently approached when it came near him 
scrooge bent down upon his knee for in the very air through which this 
spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery 

it was shrouded in a deep black garment which concealed its head its 
face its form and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched 
hand but for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure 
from the night and separate it from the darkness by which it was 
surrounded 

he felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him and that 
its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread he knew no more 
for the spirit neither spoke nor moved 

 am in the presence of the ghost of christmas yet to come said 
scrooge 

the spirit answered not but pointed onward with its hand 

you are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened 
but will happen in the time before us scrooge pursued is that so 
spirit 

the upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its 
folds as if the spirit had inclined its head that was the only answer 
he received 

although well used to ghostly company by this time scrooge feared the 
silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him and he found 
that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it the spirit 
paused a moment as observing his condition and giving him time to 
recover 

but scrooge was all the worse for this it thrilled him with a vague 
uncertain horror to know that behind the dusky shroud there were 
ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him while he though he stretched his 
own to the utmost could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great 
heap of black 

ghost of the future he exclaimed  fear you more than any spectre 
 have seen but as  know your purpose is to do me good and as  hope 
to live to be another man from what  was  am prepared to bear your 
company and do it with a thankful heart will you not speak to me 

it gave him no reply the hand was pointed straight before them 

lead on said scrooge lead on the night is waning fast and it is 
precious time to me  know lead on spirit 

the phantom moved away as it had come towards him scrooge followed in 
the shadow of its dress which bore him up he thought and carried him 
along 

they scarcely seemed to enter the city for the city rather seemed to 
spring up about them and encompass them of its own act but there they 
were in the heart of it on change amongst the merchants who hurried 
up and down and chinked the money in their pockets and conversed in 
groups and looked at their watches and trifled thoughtfully with their 
great gold seals and so forth as scrooge had seen them often 

the spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men observing 
that the hand was pointed to them scrooge advanced to listen to their 
talk 

no said a great fat man with a monstrous chin  dont know much 
about it either way  only know hes dead 

when did he die inquired another 

last night  believe 

why what was the matter with him asked a third taking a vast 
quantity of snuff out of a very large snuffbox  thought hed never 
die 

god knows said the first with a yawn 

what has he done with his money asked a redfaced gentleman with a 
pendulous excrescence on the end of his nose that shook like the gills 
of a turkeycock 

 havent heard said the man with the large chin yawning again 
left it to his company perhaps he hasnt left it to me thats all 
 know 

this pleasantry was received with a general laugh 

its likely to be a very cheap funeral said the same speaker for 
upon my life  dont know of anybody to go to it suppose we make up a 
party and volunteer 

 dont mind going if a lunch is provided observed the gentleman with 
the excrescence on his nose but  must be fed if  make one 

another laugh 

illustration 

how are you said one 
how are you returned the other 
well said the first old scratch has got his own at last hey 

 

well  am the most disinterested among you after all said the first 
speaker for  never wear black gloves and  never eat lunch but ill 
offer to go if anybody else will when  come to think of it im not 
at all sure that  wasnt his most particular friend for we used to 
stop and speak whenever we met bye bye 

speakers and listeners strolled away and mixed with other groups 
scrooge knew the men and looked towards the spirit for an explanation 

the phantom glided on into a street its finger pointed to two persons 
meeting scrooge listened again thinking that the explanation might lie 
here 

he knew these men also perfectly they were men of business very 
wealthy and of great importance he had made a point always of standing 
well in their esteem in a business point of view that is strictly in a 
business point of view 

how are you said one 

how are you returned the other 

well said the first old scratch has got his own at last hey 

so  am told returned the second cold isnt it 

seasonable for christmastime you are not a skater  suppose 

no no something else to think of goodmorning 

not another word that was their meeting their conversation and their 
parting 

scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the spirit should 
attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial but feeling 
assured that they must have some hidden purpose he set himself to 
consider what it was likely to be they could scarcely be supposed to 
have any bearing on the death of jacob his old partner for that was 
past and this ghosts province was the future nor could he think of 
any one immediately connected with himself to whom he could apply them 
but nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some 
latent moral for his own improvement he resolved to treasure up every 
word he heard and everything he saw and especially to observe the 
shadow of himself when it appeared for he had an expectation that the 
conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed and would 
render the solution of these riddles easy 

he looked about in that very place for his own image but another man 
stood in his accustomed corner and though the clock pointed to his 
usual time of day for being there he saw no likeness of himself among 
the multitudes that poured in through the porch it gave him little 
surprise however for he had been revolving in his mind a change of 
life and thought and hoped he saw his newborn resolutions carried out 
in this 

quiet and dark beside him stood the phantom with its outstretched 
hand when he roused himself from his thoughtful quest he fancied 
from the turn of the hand and its situation in reference to himself 
that the unseen eyes were looking at him keenly it made him shudder 
and feel very cold 

they left the busy scene and went into an obscure part of the town 
where scrooge had never penetrated before although he recognised its 
situation and its bad repute the ways were foul and narrow the shop 
and houses wretched the people half naked drunken slipshod ugly 
alleys and archways like so many cesspools disgorged their offences of 
smell and dirt and life upon the straggling streets and the whole 
quarter reeked with crime with filth and misery 

far in this den of infamous resort there was a lowbrowed beetling 
shop below a penthouse roof where iron old rags bottles bones and 
greasy offal were bought upon the floor within were piled up heaps of 
rusty keys nails chains hinges files scales weights and refuse 
iron of all kinds secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred 
and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags masses of corrupted fat and 
sepulchres of bones sitting in among the wares he dealt in by a 
charcoal stove made of old bricks was a greyhaired rascal nearly 
seventy years of age who had screened himself from the cold air without 
by a frouzy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters hung upon a line and 
smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement 

scrooge and the phantom came into the presence of this man just as a 
woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop but she had scarcely 
entered when another woman similarly laden came in too and she was 
closely followed by a man in faded black who was no less startled by 
the sight of them than they had been upon the recognition of each other 
after a short period of blank astonishment in which the old man with 
the pipe had joined them they all three burst into a laugh 

let the charwoman alone to be the first cried she who had entered 
first let the laundress alone to be the second and let the 
undertakers man alone to be the third look here old joe heres a 
chance if we havent all three met here without meaning it 

you couldnt have met in a better place said old joe removing his 
pipe from his mouth come into the parlour you were made free of it 
long ago you know and the other two ant strangers stop till  shut 
the door of the shop ah how it skreeks there ant such a rusty bit of 
metal in the place as its own hinges  believe and im sure theres no 
such old bones here as mine ha ha were all suitable to our calling 
were well matched come into the parlour come into the parlour 

the parlour was the space behind the screen of rags the old man raked 
the fire together with an old stairrod and having trimmed his smoky 
lamp for it was night with the stem of his pipe put it into his mouth 
again 

while he did this the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on 
the floor and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool crossing her 
elbows on her knees and looking with a bold defiance at the other two 

what odds then what odds mrs dilber said the woman every person 
has a right to take care of themselves he always did 

thats true indeed said the laundress no man more so 

why then dont stand staring as if you was afraid woman whos the 
wiser were not going to pick holes in each others coats  suppose 

no indeed said mrs dilber and the man together we should hope 
not 

very well then cried the woman thats enough whos the worse for 
the loss of a few things like these not a dead man  suppose 

no indeed said mrs dilber laughing 

if he wanted to keep em after he was dead a wicked old screw 
pursued the woman why wasnt he natural in his lifetime if he had 
been hed have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with 
death instead of lying gasping out his last there alone by himself 

its the truest word that ever was spoke said mrs dilber its a 
judgment on him 

 wish it was a little heavier judgment replied the woman and it 
should have been you may depend upon it if  could have laid my hands 
on anything else open that bundle old joe and let me know the value 
of it speak out plain im not afraid to be the first nor afraid for 
them to see it we knew pretty well that we were helping ourselves 
before we met here  believe its no sin open the bundle joe 

but the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this and the man in 
faded black mounting the breach first produced his plunder it was 
not extensive  seal or two a pencilcase a pair of sleevebuttons 
and a brooch of no great value were all they were severally examined 
and appraised by old joe who chalked the sums he was disposed to give 
for each upon the wall and added them up into a total when he found 
that there was nothing more to come 

thats your account said joe and  wouldnt give another sixpence 
if  was to be boiled for not doing it whos next 


illustration what do you call this said joe bedcurtains 

mrs dilber was next sheets and towels a little wearing apparel two 
old fashioned silver teaspoons a pair of sugartongs and a few 
boots her account was stated on the wall in the same manner 

 always give too much to ladies its a weakness of mine and thats 
the way  ruin myself said old joe thats your account if you asked 
me for another penny and made it an open question id repent of being 
so liberal and knock off halfacrown 

and now undo my bundle joe said the first woman 

joe went down on his knees for the greater convenience of opening it 
and having unfastened a great many knots dragged out a large heavy 
roll of some dark stuff 

what do you call this said joe bedcurtains 

ah returned the woman laughing and leaning forward on her crossed 
arms bedcurtains 

you dont mean to say you took em down rings and all with him lying 
there said joe 

yes  do replied the woman why not 

you were born to make your fortune said joe and youll certainly do 
it 

 certainly shant hold my hand when  can get anything in it by 
reaching it out for the sake of such a man as he was  promise you 
joe returned the woman coolly dont drop that oil upon the blankets 
now 

his blankets asked joe 

whose elses do you think replied the woman he isnt likely to take 
cold without em  dare say 

 hope he didnt die of anything catching eh said old joe stopping 
in his work and looking up 

dont you be afraid of that returned the woman  ant so fond of 
his company that id loiter about him for such things if he did ah 
you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache but you wont find 
a hole in it nor a threadbare place its the best he had and a fine 
one too theyd have wasted it if it hadnt been for me 

what do you call wasting of it asked old joe 

putting it on him to be buried in to be sure replied the woman with 
a laugh somebody was fool enough to do it but  took it off again if 
calico ant good enough for such a purpose it isnt good enough for 
anything its quite as becoming to the body he cant look uglier than 
he did in that one 

scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror as they sat grouped about 
their spoil in the scanty light afforded by the old mans lamp he 
viewed them with a detestation and disgust which could hardly have been 
greater though they had been obscene demons marketing the corpse 
itself 

ha ha laughed the same woman when old joe producing a flannel bag 
with money in it told out their several gains upon the ground this 
is the end of it you see he frightened every one away from him when he 
was alive to profit us when he was dead ha ha ha 

spirit said scrooge shuddering from head to foot  see  see the 
case of this unhappy man might be my own my life tends that way now 
merciful heaven what is this 

he recoiled in terror for the scene had changed and now he almost 
touched a beda bare uncurtained bedon which beneath a ragged 
sheet there lay a something covered up which though it was dumb 
announced itself in awful language 

the room was very dark too dark to be observed with any accuracy 
though scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse 
anxious to know what kind of room it was  pale light rising in the 
outer air fell straight upon the bed and on it plundered and bereft 
unwatched unwept uncared for was the body of this man 

scrooge glanced towards the phantom its steady hand was pointed to the 
head the cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of 
it the motion of a finger upon scrooges part would have disclosed the 
face he thought of it felt how easy it would be to do and longed to 
do it but he had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the 
spectre at his side 

oh cold cold rigid dreadful death set up thine altar here and 
dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command for this is thy 
dominion but of the loved revered and honoured head thou canst not 
turn one hair to thy dread purposes or make one feature odious it is 
not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released it is not 
that the heart and pulse are still but that the hand was open 
generous and true the heart brave warm and tender and the pulse a 
mans strike shadow strike and see his good deeds springing from the 
wound to sow the world with life immortal 

no voice pronounced these words in scrooges ears and yet he heard them 
when he looked upon the bed he thought if this man could be raised up 
now what would be his foremost thoughts avarice hard dealing griping 
cares they have brought him to a rich end truly 

he lay in the dark empty house with not a man a woman or a child to 
say he was kind to me in this or that and for the memory of one kind 
word  will be kind to him  cat was tearing at the door and there was 
a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearthstone what they wanted in 
the room of death and why they were so restless and disturbed scrooge 
did not dare to think 

spirit he said this is a fearful place in leaving it  shall not 
leave its lesson trust me let us go 

still the ghost pointed with an unmoved finger to the head 

 understand you scrooge returned and  would do it if  could but 
 have not the power spirit  have not the power 

again it seemed to look upon him 

if there is any person in the town who feels emotion caused by this 
mans death said scrooge quite agonised show that person to me 
spirit  beseech you 

the phantom spread its dark robe before him for a moment like a wing 
and withdrawing it revealed a room by daylight where a mother and her 
children were 

she was expecting some one and with anxious eagerness for she walked 
up and down the room started at every sound looked out from the 
window glanced at the clock tried but in vain to work with her 
needle and could hardly bear the voices of her children in their play 

at length the longexpected knock was heard she hurried to the door 
and met her husband a man whose face was careworn and depressed though 
he was young there was a remarkable expression in it now a kind of 
serious delight of which he felt ashamed and which he struggled to 
repress 

he sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire 
and when she asked him faintly what news which was not until after a 
long silence he appeared embarrassed how to answer 

is it good she said or bad to help him 

bad he answered 

we are quite ruined 

no there is hope yet caroline 

if he relents she said amazed there is nothing is past hope if 
such a miracle has happened 

he is past relenting said her husband he is dead 

she was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke truth but she 
was thankful in her soul to hear it and she said so with clasped hands 
she prayed forgiveness the next moment and was sorry but the first was 
the emotion of her heart 

what the halfdrunken woman whom  told you of last night said to me 
when  tried to see him and obtain a weeks delayand what  thought 
was a mere excuse to avoid meturns out to have been quite true he was 
not only very ill but dying then 

to whom will our debt be transferred 

 dont know but before that time we shall be ready with the money 
and even though we were not it would be bad fortune indeed to find so 
merciless a creditor in his successor we may sleep tonight with light 
hearts caroline 

yes soften it as they would their hearts were lighter the childrens 
faces hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little 
understood were brighter and it was a happier house for this mans 
death the only emotion that the ghost could show him caused by the 
event was one of pleasure 

let me see some tenderness connected with a death said scrooge or 
that dark chamber spirit which we left just now will be for ever 
present to me 

the ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet 
and as they went along scrooge looked here and there to find himself 
but nowhere was he to be seen they entered poor bob cratchits house 
the dwelling he had visited before and found the mother and the 
children seated round the fire 

quiet very quiet the noisy little cratchits were as still as statues 
in one corner and sat looking up at peter who had a book before him 
the mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing but surely they 
were very quiet 

and he took a child and set him in the midst of them 

where had scrooge heard those words he had not dreamed them the boy 
must have read them out as he and the spirit crossed the threshold why 
did he not go on 

the mother laid her work upon the table and put her hand up to her 
face 

the colour hurts my eyes she said 

the colour ah poor tiny tim 

theyre better now again said cratchits wife it makes them weak by 
candlelight and  wouldnt show weak eyes to your father when he comes 
home for the world it must be near his time 

past it rather peter answered shutting up his book but  think he 
has walked a little slower than he used these few last evenings 
mother 

they were very quiet again at last she said and in a steady cheerful 
voice that only faltered once 

 have known him walk withi have known him walk with tiny tim upon 
his shoulder very fast indeed 

and so have  cried peter often 

and so have  exclaimed another so had all 

but he was very light to carry she resumed intent upon her work 
and his father loved him so that it was no trouble no trouble and 
there is your father at the door 

she hurried out to meet him and little bob in his comforterhe had 
need of it poor fellowcame in his tea was ready for him on the hob 
and they all tried who should help him to it most then the two young 
cratchits got upon his knees and laid each child a little cheek 
against his face as if they said dont mind it father dont be 
grieved 

bob was very cheerful with them and spoke pleasantly to all the family 
he looked at the work upon the table and praised the industry and speed 
of mrs cratchit and the girls they would be done long before sunday 
he said 

sunday you went today then robert said his wife 

yes my dear returned bob  wish you could have gone it would have 
done you good to see how green a place it is but youll see it often  
promised him that  would walk there on a sunday my little little 
child cried bob my little child 

he broke down all at once he couldnt help it if he could have helped 
it he and his child would have been farther apart perhaps than they 
were 

he left the room and went upstairs into the room above which was 
lighted cheerfully and hung with christmas there was a chair set close 
beside the child and there were signs of some one having been there 
lately poor bob sat down in it and when he had thought a little and 
composed himself he kissed the little face he was reconciled to what 
had happened and went down again quite happy 

they drew about the fire and talked the girls and mother working 
still bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of mr scrooges 
nephew whom he had scarcely seen but once and who meeting him in the 
street that day and seeing that he looked a littlejust a little 
down you know said bob inquired what had happened to distress him 
on which said bob for he is the pleasantestspoken gentleman you 
ever heard  told him  am heartily sorry for it mr cratchit he 
said and heartily sorry for your good wife bythebye how he ever 
knew that  dont know 

knew what my dear 

why that you were a good wife replied bob 

everybody knows that said peter 

very well observed my boy cried bob  hope they do heartily 
sorry he said for your good wife if  can be of service to you in 
any way he said giving me his card thats where  live pray come 
to me now it wasnt cried bob for the sake of anything he might 
be able to do for us so much as for his kind way that this was quite 
delightful it really seemed as if he had known our tiny tim and felt 
with us 

im sure hes a good soul said mrs cratchit 

you would be sure of it my dear returned bob if you saw and spoke 
to him  shouldnt be at all surprisedmark what  sayif he got 
peter a better situation 

only hear that peter said mrs cratchit 

and then cried one of the girls peter will be keeping company with 
some one and setting up for himself 

get along with you retorted peter grinning 

its just as likely as not said bob one of these days though 
theres plenty of time for that my dear but however and whenever we 
part from one another  am sure we shall none of us forget poor tiny 
timshall weor this first parting that there was among us 

never father cried they all 

and  know said bob  know my dears that when we recollect how 
patient and how mild he was although he was a little little child we 
shall not quarrel easily among ourselves and forget poor tiny tim in 
doing it 

no never father they all cried again 

 am very happy said little bob  am very happy 

mrs cratchit kissed him his daughters kissed him the two young 
cratchits kissed him and peter and himself shook hands spirit of tiny 
tim thy childish essence was from god 

spectre said scrooge something informs me that our parting moment 
is at hand  know it but  know not how tell me what man that was whom 
we saw lying dead 

the ghost of christmas yet to come conveyed him as beforethough at a 
different time he thought indeed there seemed no order in these latter 
visions save that they were in the futureinto the resorts of business 
men but showed him not himself indeed the spirit did not stay for 
anything but went straight on as to the end just now desired until 
besought by scrooge to tarry for a moment 

this court said scrooge through which we hurry now is where my 
place of occupation is and has been for a length of time  see the 
house let me behold what  shall be in days to come 

the spirit stopped the hand was pointed elsewhere 

the house is yonder scrooge exclaimed why do you point away 

the inexorable finger underwent no change 

scrooge hastened to the window of his office and looked in it was an 
office still but not his the furniture was not the same and the 
figure in the chair was not himself the phantom pointed as before 

he joined it once again and wondering why and whither he had gone 
accompanied it until they reached an iron gate he paused to look round 
before entering 

 churchyard here then the wretched man whose name he had now to 
learn lay underneath the ground it was a worthy place walled in by 
houses overrun by grass and weeds the growth of vegetations death 
not life choked up with too much burying fat with repleted appetite  
worthy place 

the spirit stood among the graves and pointed down to one he advanced 
towards it trembling the phantom was exactly as it had been but he 
dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape 

before  draw nearer to that stone to which you point said scrooge 
answer me one question are these the shadows of the things that will 
be or are they shadows of the things that may be only 

still the ghost pointed downward to the grave by which it stood 

mens courses will foreshadow certain ends to which if persevered in 
they must lead said scrooge but if the courses be departed from the 
ends will change say it is thus with what you show me 

the spirit was immovable as ever 

scrooge crept towards it trembling as he went and following the 
finger read upon the stone of the neglected grave his own name 
  

am  that man who lay upon the bed he cried upon his knees 

the finger pointed from the grave to him and back again 

no spirit oh no no 

the finger still was there 

spirit he cried tight clutching at its robe hear me  am not the 
man  was  will not be the man  must have been but for this 
intercourse why show me this if  am past all hope 

for the first time the hand appeared to shake 

good spirit he pursued as down upon the ground he fell before it 
your nature intercedes for me and pities me assure me that  yet may 
change these shadows you have shown me by an altered life 

the kind hand trembled 

 will honour christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year  
will live in the past the present and the future the spirits of all 
three shall strive within me  will not shut out the lessons that they 
teach oh tell me  may sponge away the writing on this stone 

in his agony he caught the spectral hand it sought to free itself but 
he was strong in his entreaty and detained it the spirit stronger yet 
repulsed him 

holding up his hands in a last prayer to have his fate reversed he saw 
an alteration in the phantoms hood and dress it shrunk collapsed and 
dwindled down into a bedpost 


  


illustration 




    


yes and the bedpost was his own the bed was his own the room was his 
own best and happiest of all the time before him was his own to make 
amends in 

 will live in the past the present and the future scrooge repeated 
as he scrambled out of bed the spirits of all three shall strive 
within me  jacob marley heaven and the christmas time be praised for 
this  say it on my knees old jacob on my knees 

he was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions that his 
broken voice would scarcely answer to his call he had been sobbing 
violently in his conflict with the spirit and his face was wet with 
tears 

they are not torn down cried scrooge folding one of his bedcurtains 
in his arms they are not torn down rings and all they are herei am 
herethe shadows of the things that would have been may be dispelled 
they will be  know they will 

his hands were busy with his garments all this time turning them inside 
out putting them on upside down tearing them mislaying them making 
them parties to every kind of extravagance 

 dont know what to do cried scrooge laughing and crying in the 
same breath and making a perfect laocoon of himself with his stockings 
 am as light as a feather  am as happy as an angel  am as merry as 
a schoolboy  am as giddy as a drunken man  merry christmas to 
everybody  happy new year to all the world hallo here whoop hallo 

he had frisked into the sittingroom and was now standing there 
perfectly winded 

theres the saucepan that the gruel was in cried scrooge starting 
off again and going round the fireplace theres the door by which the 
ghost of jacob marley entered theres the corner where the ghost of 
christmas present sat theres the window where  saw the wandering 
spirits its all right its all true it all happened ha ha ha 

really for a man who had been out of practice for so many years it was 
a splendid laugh a most illustrious laugh the father of a long long 
line of brilliant laughs 

 dont know what day of the month it is said scrooge  dont know 
how long  have been among the spirits  dont know anything im quite 
a baby never mind  dont care id rather be a baby hallo whoop 
hallo here 

he was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the 
lustiest peals he had ever heard clash clash hammer ding dong 
bell bell dong ding hammer clash clash oh glorious glorious 

running to the window he opened it and put out his head no fog no 
mist clear bright jovial stirring cold cold piping for the blood 
to dance to golden sunlight heavenly sky sweet fresh air merry 
bells oh glorious glorious 

whats today cried scrooge calling downward to a boy in sunday 
clothes who perhaps had loitered in to look about him 

 returned the boy with all his might of wonder 

whats today my fine fellow said scrooge 

today replied the boy why   

its christmas day said scrooge to himself  havent missed it the 
spirits have done it all in one night they can do anything they like 
of course they can of course they can hallo my fine fellow 

hallo returned the boy 

do you know the poulterers in the next street but one at the corner 
scrooge inquired 

 should hope  did replied the lad 

an intelligent boy said scrooge  remarkable boy do you know 
whether theyve sold the prize turkey that was hanging up therenot 
the little prize turkey the big one 

what the one as big as me returned the boy 

what a delightful boy said scrooge its a pleasure to talk to him 
yes my buck 

its hanging there now replied the boy 

is it said scrooge go and buy it 

walker exclaimed the boy 

no no said scrooge  am in earnest go and buy it and tell em to 
bring it here that  may give them the directions where to take it 
come back with the man and ill give you a shilling come back with him 
in less than five minutes and ill give you halfacrown 

the boy was off like a shot he must have had a steady hand at a trigger 
who could have got a shot off half as fast 

ill send it to bob cratchits whispered scrooge rubbing his hands 
and splitting with a laugh he shant know who sends it its twice the 
size of tiny tim joe miller never made such a joke as sending it to 
bobs will be 

the hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one but write 
it he did somehow and went downstairs to open the streetdoor ready 
for the coming of the poulterers man as he stood there waiting his 
arrival the knocker caught his eye 

 shall love it as long as  live cried scrooge patting it with his 
hand  scarcely ever looked at it before what an honest expression it 
has in its face its a wonderful knockerheres the turkey hallo 
whoop how are you merry christmas 

it was a turkey he never could have stood upon his legs that bird 
he would have snapped em short off in a minute like sticks of 
sealingwax 

why its impossible to carry that to camden town said scrooge you 
must have a cab 

the chuckle with which he said this and the chuckle with which he paid 
for the turkey and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab and the 
chuckle with which he recompensed the boy were only to be exceeded by 
the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again and 
chuckled till he cried 

shaving was not an easy task for his hand continued to shake very much 
and shaving requires attention even when you dont dance while you are 
at it but if he had cut the end of his nose off he would have put a 
piece of stickingplaster over it and been quite satisfied 

he dressed himself all in his best and at last got out into the 
streets the people were by this time pouring forth as he had seen them 
with the ghost of christmas present and walking with his hands behind 
him scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile he looked so 
irresistibly pleasant in a word that three or four goodhumoured 
fellows said goodmorning sir  merry christmas to you and scrooge 
said often afterwards that of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard 
those were the blithest in his ears 

he had not gone far when coming on towards him he beheld the portly 
gentleman who had walked into his countinghouse the day before and 
said scrooge and marleys  believe it sent a pang across his heart 
to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met but 
he knew what path lay straight before him and he took it 

my dear sir said scrooge quickening his pace and taking the old 
gentleman by both his hands how do you do  hope you succeeded 
yesterday it was very kind of you  merry christmas to you sir 

mr scrooge 

yes said scrooge that is my name and  fear it may not be pleasant 
to you allow me to ask your pardon and will you have the goodness 
here scrooge whispered in his ear 

lord bless me cried the gentleman as if his breath were taken away 
my dear mr scrooge are you serious 

if you please said scrooge not a farthing less  great many 
backpayments are included in it  assure you will you do me that 
favour 

my dear sir said the other shaking hands with him  dont know 
what to say to such munifi 

dont say anything please retorted scrooge come and see me will 
you come and see me 

 will cried the old gentleman and it was clear he meant to do it 

thankee said scrooge  am much obliged to you  thank you fifty 
times bless you 

he went to church and walked about the streets and watched the people 
hurrying to and fro and patted the children on the head and questioned 
beggars and looked down into the kitchens of houses and up to the 
windows and found that everything could yield him pleasure he had 
never dreamed that any walkthat anythingcould give him so much 
happiness in the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephews 
house 

he passed the door a dozen times before he had the courage to go up and 
knock but he made a dash and did it 

is your master at home my dear said scrooge to the girl nice girl 
very 

yes sir 

where is he my love said scrooge 

hes in the diningroom sir along with mistress ill show you 
upstairs if you please 

thankee he knows me said scrooge with his hand already on the 
diningroom lock ill go in here my dear 

he turned it gently and sidled his face in round the door they were 
looking at the table which was spread out in great array for these 
young housekeepers are always nervous on such points and like to see 
that everything is right 

fred said scrooge 

dear heart alive how his niece by marriage started scrooge had 
forgotten for the moment about her sitting in the corner with the 
footstool or he wouldnt have done it on any account 

why bless my soul cried fred whos that 

illustration its  your uncle scrooge  have come to dinner will

five minutes nothing could be heartier his niece looked just the same 
so did topper when he came so did the plump sister when she came 
so did every one when they came wonderful party wonderful games 
wonderful unanimity wonderful happiness 

but he was early at the office next morning oh he was early there if 
he could only be there first and catch bob cratchit coming late that 
was the thing he had set his heart upon 

and he did it yes he did the clock struck nine no bob  quarter 
past no bob he was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time 
scrooge sat with his door wide open that he might see him come into the 
tank 

his hat was off before he opened the door his comforter too he was on 
his stool in a jiffy driving away with his pen as if he were trying to 
overtake nine oclock 

hallo growled scrooge in his accustomed voice as near as he could 
feign it what do you mean by coming here at this time of day

stand this sort of thing any longer and therefore he continued 
leaping from his stool and giving bob such a dig in the waistcoat that 
he staggered back into the tank againand therefore  am about to 
raise your salary 

bob trembled and got a little nearer to the ruler he had a momentary 
idea of knocking scrooge down with it holding him and calling to the 
people in the court for help and a straitwaistcoat 

 merry christmas bob said scrooge with an earnestness that could 
not be mistaken as he clapped him on the back  merrier christmas 
bob my good fellow than  have given you for many a year ill raise 
your salary and endeavour to assist your struggling family and we will 
discuss your affairs this very afternoon over a christmas bowl of 
smoking bishop bob make up the fires and buy another coalscuttle 
before you dot another i bob cratchit 

illustration now ill tell you what my friend said scrooge  
am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer 

scrooge was better than his word he did it all and infinitely more 
and to tiny tim who did  die he was a second father he became as 
good a friend as good a master and as good a man as the good old 
city knew or any other good old city town or borough in the good old 
world some people laughed to see the alteration in him but he let them 
laugh and little heeded them for he was wise enough to know that 
nothing ever happened on this globe for good at which some people did 
not have their fill of laughter in the outset and knowing that such as 
these would be blind anyway he thought it quite as well that they 
should wrinkle up their eyes in grins as have the malady in less 
attractive forms his own heart laughed and that was quite enough for 
him 

he had no further intercourse with spirits but lived upon the 
totalabstinence principle ever afterwards and it was always said of 
him that he knew how to keep christmas well if any man alive possessed 
the knowledge may that be truly said of us and all of us and so as 
tiny tim observed god bless us every one
